<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first edition of this work was published in 1896,
and the treatment of the subject was so highly commended
by many leading men and periodicals of the
country that the entire edition, though a large one,
was soon exhausted. In spite of this favorable commendation,
which may have been due to my effort to
set forth reasons, instead of rules, for the use of
marks, I had a keen sense of certain shortcomings in
the work, and have long been unwilling to permit its
reprinting or to undertake its rewriting. At least
one of the reasons—and I hope the principal one—why
the work fell short of my ideal of the book
needed, was the inevitable failure inherent in the
mode of treating the subject. As a sentence may
contain the four principal marks (comma, semicolon,
colon, and period) and, in addition, one or more of
the other marks, a writer courts failure if, in treating
the difficult art of punctuation, he deals with the
marks separately, beginning, as all writers, myself
included, have hitherto done, with the comma, the
most difficult mark to understand, and proceeding,
one at a time, with the other marks. Failure follows
this mode of treatment because it disregards the interrelation
of marks and the relations between groups
of words to be interpreted by marks.</p>

<p>In this edition, which has been entirely rewritten,
I have endeavored to avoid the fault of such mode of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
treatment, and have dealt, from the outset, with
groups of interrelated marks, exhibiting, for instance,
in a single illustrative sentence (No. 6) the four
principal marks in their interrelation as affected by
the sense relations of the language of the sentence.
I believe that this treatment of the subject of punctuation
is the only logical one; and because of the lack
of a logical treatment of the subject it is no exaggeration
to say that almost utter chaos as regards punctuation
which is helpful to both reader and writer,
exists everywhere, inside and outside of printing-offices.</p>

<p>In the preface of the first edition I said it was a
remarkable fact that the subject of punctuation had
been very inadequately treated, as evidenced by the
existence at that time of only a single treatise on
punctuation in the English language, and by the
total absence of any consideration of it in periodical
literature. This assertion, with slight modification,
is true today. An admirable essay by Mr. Phillips
Garrison, sometime editor of <i>The Nation</i>, appeared in
the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> for August, 1906. This essay,
which deals with the interchangeability of marks, only
confounds the confusion of punctuation. Mr. Garrison
admits that the more the difficulties of the
art of punctuation are faced and considered, the fuller
becomes our understanding of the principles which
do underlie the convention that makes punctuation
correct or faulty. One of his illustrative examples
exhibiting the interchangeability of three marks, is
discussed herein; and an effort is made to discover
the “principles” that determine the correct punctua<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>tion
of the example, and to show that the marks used
by him are not interchangeable. No other article
on punctuation is found in the world’s great mass of
periodical literature listed in American library Indexes.</p>

<p>The one treatise referred to above is the work of
Mr. John Wilson, which, it may safely be asserted,
is the only <i>treatise</i> on the subject in English. It is a
masterful work, exhibiting an amount of research and
a degree of acumen probably unexcelled in the
preparation of a text-book on any subject. In spite
of this fact, I think the work is so minute, so voluminous,
and so lacking in scientific generalization,
as to make mastery of its great number of rules,
with “remarks” and exceptions equivalent to rules,
an exceedingly difficult and, to many, an impossible
task. Mr. Wilson’s work was first published in 1826.</p>

<p>The excellent handbook of Mr. Marshall T.
Bigelow, published in 1881, is merely a summary of
the principal rules of Mr. Wilson’s work. Its briefness
greatly limits its value.</p>

<p>The work, entitled “Punctuation,” of Mr. F.
Horace Teall, published in 1897, is also an admirable
handbook, but it gives more space to spelling than
to punctuation. It gives only four pages, very small
ones, to the consideration of the colon; and two of
the colon’s principal uses, discussed at length herein,
are not mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. Theodore L. De Vinne, the founder of the
well-known De Vinne Press, published his “Correct
Composition” in 1901. This work is indeed a
treatise, but a treatise on printing, not on punctuation.
Its treatment of punctuation is somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
iconoclastic, radically so at points. Some of its
rules are excellent, but others are well-nigh incomprehensible.</p>

<p>The University of Chicago Press issued its
“Manual of Style” in 1906, and its “Manual for
Writers” in 1913. The latter work is edited by
Professor John Matthews Manly, head of the Department
of English in the University of Chicago,
and Mr. John Arthur Powell, of the University of
Chicago Press. These Manuals, in their treatment
of punctuation, are practically identical, and each
devotes less than thirty pages to the subject. Their
rules are brief, clear, and comprehensive; but their
inconsistencies in the use of marks are so great as to
be exceedingly puzzling.</p>

<p>The Riverside Press, which for many years maintained
the reputation of being one of the three or
four most painstaking printing establishments in the
world, recently issued a small “Handbook of Style,”
setting forth the style in use by that Press; but it
also contains many errors and inconsistencies in
punctuation, which lessen its value.</p>

<p>I have assumed, for several reasons, the seeming
impropriety of criticising the above books: (1) they
are recognized as the best authorities on the conventional
use of marks, I acknowledge my indebtedness
to them, and I show my appreciation of them by
quoting no others in my discussion of the subject;
(2) criticism of usage by any other class of writers is
worthless; (3) my own work, if it will not stand comparison
with the above-named works, has no value,
and I invite such comparison by my specific criticism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
of some of their examples which exhibit the fundamental
principles of punctuation.</p>

<p>In no work known to me has an attempt been
made to show the sense relations between parts of
language with such relations indicated by marks,
themselves differentiated by these sense relations.
A single illustration will serve to show the truth of
this broad assertion concerning the sense relations
between groups of words determined by marks, yet
not recognized by writers on punctuation. Practically
all such writers use a comma after <i>etc.</i>, the
comma of course following the period. The two
Manuals of the University of Chicago Press and the
Handbook of The Riverside Press specifically name
this as the proper punctuation. That such punctuation
disregards the sense relations determined by the
meaning of language, is proved, I think, beyond
question by illustrative Sentence 7-1 herein.</p>

<p>If my own work is of any value, or possesses any
degree of originality, it is to be found in my efforts
to show that the sense relations between groups of
words are a large factor in determining the meaning
of language, and that a mark of punctuation, or even
its absence, sometimes determines a sense relation,
and at other times only serves readily to point it out.
Neither the comma in illustrative Sentence 1-1 nor
the semicolons in Sentence 7 determine meanings:
they simply suggest them. The absence of commas
in Sentence 3, and their presence in Sentence 3-1,
determine meanings.</p>

<p>As the difficulties in punctuation arise largely
from the subtle relations between groups of words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
into which all language, often the simplest, is divided,
the study of punctuation becomes in reality the
study of language. Upon the importance attached
to the clear understanding and correct use of language,
depends the value of punctuation.</p>

<p>I desire to express my high appreciation of the
helpful suggestions and criticisms made by three
friends, each of whom has read the proof of this work
one or more times, bringing to the arduous task large
knowledge of the subtle principles of punctuation and
of language. Of these friends, Mr. W. F. Webster,
Principal of the East High School, Minneapolis, is
well known in educational circles as a teacher of
English, as a lecturer, and as the author of a widely
used text-book on composition and literature. Mr.
S. R. Winchell, of Chicago, is likewise well known in
educational circles as a high-school and college
teacher, and as the author of several text-books on
English and Latin. Dr. William Davis, of St. Paul,
is an unusually critical scholar and a lover of good
English, with an extensive editorial experience.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I hope</span> my appreciation of the difficulties which
beset the student and teacher of punctuation may
justify a suggestion from me as to a good method in
the study of the subject with this book as a guide.</p>

<p>Until one has gained almost complete mastery of
the meanings of marks and of the subtle sense relations
between the groups of words constituting
language, he cannot interpret such relations when
indicated by marks or by their omission. The first
step, then, for the student is not to give extended
consideration to points discussed herein which are
not readily comprehended by him, but to gain
mastery of the reasons for the use of marks which
indicate language relations that are thoroughly
familiar to him. The principles of punctuation,
unlike the principles of mathematics, are not regularly
progressive from the simple to the complex; therefore
the student should not attempt to master consecutively
such principles. Let him, rather, read
the entire work carefully, marking with his pencil
the illustrative sentences whose punctuation presents
principles which, though new to him, are still obvious.
This course, repeated with special attention to the
marked sentences, will, I am sure, give him a comprehension
of the nice relations in language which
may be clearly pointed out by marks of punctuation
based upon reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span></p>

<p>Having in this way gained a fairly complete
knowledge of the fine use of marks, that is, of <i>close</i>
punctuation, he will naturally begin so to frame his
own written language that many marks may safely
be omitted, thus gaining mastery of an <i>open</i> punctuation
that will not destroy clearness of expression.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">AN ANNOUNCEMENT</span></p>

<p>I am now engaged in the preparation of a briefer
book than this one, omitting most of the discussion,
but retaining the reasons, briefly stated, for the use
of marks. I hope to be able to make the treatment
of the subject, even in a small handbook, so clear that
all the ordinary uses of marks may be readily mastered
by one who has not had a thorough high-school or
college training in language.</p>

<p><small>Always read the preface [and the introduction] to a book.
It places you on vantage-ground, and enables you to survey
more completely the book itself. You frequently also discover
the character of the author from the preface. You see his aims,
perhaps his prejudices. You see the point of view from which
he takes his pictures, the rocks and impediments which he himself
beholds, and you steer accordingly.—<i>Bryan Waller Procter.</i></small></p>

THE FUNCTIONS OF MARKS, AND HOW
PERFORMED</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A mark</span> of punctuation is used because it has a
meaning, and serves a useful, if not an indispensable,
purpose in printed language.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> In order to serve
such purpose, the meaning of the mark must be
thoroughly understood by both the writer and the
reader.</p>

<p>The function of marks is twofold:</p>

<p>1. To reveal the <i>real</i> meaning of printed language.</p>

<p>2. To reveal such meaning <i>at a glance</i>.</p>

<p>Marks perform this function in three ways:</p>

<p>1. By breaking up apparent groups of words,
which readily form themselves into new groups.</p>

<p>2. By showing the relations between groups.</p>

<p>3. By characterizing a group of words.</p>

<p>Language, both printed and spoken, conveys meaning,
not only by the meanings of the words constituting
such language, but by the meanings of the relations
between the words, used singly or in groups. In
spoken language these relations are indicated, at least
to a considerable extent, by pauses and by inflections
of the voice; in printed language, however, we are
compelled to use punctuation to indicate them. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>spoken language is generally quite different from
written language, marks of punctuation do not always
indicate voice-inflections; but, as both marks and inflections
express the sense relations between groups
of words, they are not infrequently suggestive of
each other. For instance, each of the three end-marks
groups words into a sentence, and tells what
kind of a sentence it follows. Let us illustrate this
in a dialogue between a teacher and a pupil:</p>

<p><i>Pupil.</i> John has gone home.</p>
<p><i>Teacher.</i> John has gone home? [or]</p>
<p><i>Teacher.</i> John has gone home!</p>

<p>We call the first sentence a <i>declarative</i> sentence
because it makes a declaration. We call the second,
regardless of its form, an <i>interrogative</i> sentence because
it asks a question (interrogates). We call the
third an <i>exclamatory</i> sentence because it expresses
surprise (exclamation).</p>

<p>In the oral conversation between the teacher and
the pupil the voice would readily indicate the meaning
of each sentence; but on the printed page marks of
punctuation are necessary to convey the meaning.
Thus each mark in these sentences <i>characterizes</i> the
kind of sentence it follows, and thus reveals the <i>real</i>
meaning of the language.</p>

<p>The meanings of these three marks are so plain
that they give little trouble to any reader, even the
youngest. Most of the marks that fall within the
sentence should convey meanings quite as plainly and
quite as readily as do these three end-marks. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
the purpose of our study that they be made to do so,
for they are quite as useful as the end-marks.</p>

<p>Marks are used intelligently only when each mark
can give an intelligent answer to the reader who,
meeting it on the printed page, challenges it with
“What do you say to me?” This challenge may be
made the supreme test of the value of any mark of
punctuation.</p>

<p class="tb">The function of marks can best be shown by a
study of their uses in illustrative examples:<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Respect the rights of children and their mothers
will respect you.</p></blockquote>

<p>No mark is required in this sentence to reveal its
real meaning, for that is unmistakable; but almost
any reader will momentarily mistake the meaning at
the point where it seems to read as if written “the
rights of children and <i>of</i> their mothers.” When
the reader discovers that “the rights of their mothers”
are not referred to, he is like a traveler who has taken
the wrong road, and, discovering his mistake, must
retrace his steps.</p>

<p>If a mistake has been made in reading this sentence,
the reader must go back to the point where the mistake
was made, and regroup the words. The process
of regrouping the parts of a sentence is both distracting
and tiresome when reading silently, and is
very awkward when reading aloud.</p>

<p>The mistake is a mistake in grouping, that is in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>making one group of the words “children and their
mothers” when these words are not so grouped by
the meaning of the language.</p>

<p>We call “and” a <i>conjunction</i>, that is, a <i>grouping</i>
word. It naturally groups together the two words
between which it stands, especially if they make
sense when so grouped. If these words are not to be
thus grouped, the reader will be helped by having
notice to this effect at the point where a wrong grouping
may be made. We place a sign-board to guide a
traveler; and one is equally useful to guide a reader.
A mark of punctuation is the reader’s sign-board;
and it is <i>to be read</i> for its <i>directions</i>.</p>

<p class="tb">As we cannot well discuss at this point in our
study the proper mark to use in Sentence 1 we may
select the comma, leaving the reason for the selection
to be considered later. Thus the sentence written
with a sign-board, is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1-1.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Respect the rights of children, and their
mothers will respect you.</p></blockquote>

<p>The answer to the challenge, “What do you mean?”
put by the reader to the comma in this sentence,
would be somewhat like this: “Reader, ‘and’ is not
to be followed by a word with the same relation
to ‘of’ that ‘children’ sustains to ‘of.’” In other
words, “and” does not form the very simple group
of words that it appears to form without the comma:
it forms a new group.</p>

<p>With this notice, the first group is quite auto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>matically
formed by the reader; for the meaning of the
language up to this point has been fully comprehended,
and is not to be supplemented by any word in the
<i>and</i> relation to “children.”</p>

<p class="tb">In a sentence as simple in its grouping as No. 1,
the liability to error is not very great, especially for
one who has read much; nor is the readjustment of
the thought, in case such a reader has made a mistake,
very difficult for him. In more complex sentences,
the confusion of ideas becomes more marked,
and more difficult of readjustment even by the experienced
reader:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>2<span class="gesperrt3">....</span> Far beyond this group of beautiful hills
fell gradually to the plain.</p></blockquote>

<p>The words in the first line of this sentence, as
above printed, group themselves together in a natural
manner, forming a definite picture; but, when the
reader reaches the first word in the second line, he discovers
that a subject must be found for “fell,” for he
has made a wrong grouping. It is probable that most
readers would read to the end of the sentence in search
of a clue to the proper grouping, then turn back to the
beginning, and regroup the words after a careful study
of their relations. Although the sense is thus easily
obtained, the process of regrouping is distracting.</p>

<p>The trouble arises from the fact that the words in
the first line naturally fall into a group which makes
good sense, but not the sense intended by the writer.
A mark (sign-board) is needed to show the reader
that the <i>natural</i> grouping is not the correct grouping.
We mean by the “natural” grouping that grouping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
which arises from reading the words in the usual way,
thus making “this group of beautiful hills” the object
of “beyond.” In other words, the <i>natural</i> meaning
is the <i>apparent</i> meaning.</p>

<p>When the <i>apparent</i> meaning is not the <i>real</i> meaning,
the reader is momentarily misled,—that is, he
gets off the real line of thought, just as a traveler gets
off the right road.</p>

<p>With a sign-board the sentence will read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>2-1. Far beyond, this group of beautiful hills
fell gradually to the plain.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this detached sentence we do not know the
object of “beyond.” It would, however, be furnished
by what preceded it in the context; and yet the
liability to error in reading the complete, unpunctuated
sentence would still exist. Let us supply the context:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>2-2. In the morning we saw in the east a group of
hills, the crest of which we reached at noonday. Far
beyond, this group of beautiful hills fell gradually to the
plain.</p></blockquote>

<p>The context furnishes the object of “beyond,”
which is “the crest.”</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">REAL AND APPARENT MEANINGS</h3>

<p>Let us examine somewhat more carefully the
meanings of “real” and “apparent,” terms which we
have used, and shall continue to use, in our study.</p>

<p>The <i>real</i> meaning of any group of words is the
meaning it unquestionably conveys to the intelligent
reader after careful examination, if such an examination
be required by its complexity. It is also the
meaning the writer presumably desires to convey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>apparent</i> meaning of such group of words is
the meaning it conveys when read at sight.</p>

<p>The apparent meaning should always be the real
meaning. If it is not, the language needs either
recasting or regrouping. Recasting is done by changing
the positions of words or by the use of new words.
Regrouping is done by the use of marks of punctuation,
which thus perform their functions. Each of
the three end-marks also determines the character of
the group it follows, as we have already seen.</p>

<p>In Sentences 1 and 2 we obtained the apparent,
and <i>wrong</i>, meaning at the first reading; and we
obtained the real (right) meaning at the second
reading. Marks, understood by the writer and the
reader, give the reader the real meaning at the first
reading, at least when the marks are used properly.</p>

<p>In each of Sentences 1-1 and 2-1 the mark of
punctuation was used to <i>disconnect</i> words apparently
connected. In Sentence 1-1 the apparent connection
was made by a conjunction (and); in Sentence 2-1 it
was made by a preposition (beyond). Thus, in each
corrected sentence, the comma performed the office of
<i>disjunction</i>; and therefore the comma might be called
a <i>disjunctive</i>. When the reader thus disconnects
words he regroups them, and learns, quite automatically,
the proper relation between the new groups.</p>

<p>Let us note carefully that we are not dealing with
difficult or obscure processes, but with processes
familiar to the ordinary reader, and equally familiar
to the speaker, this grouping being done in speaking,
as already stated, by inflections of the voice and by
pauses, which are understood by very young readers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<p>The relations between words and groups of words
are expressed in terms of grammar; but we shall avoid
in our discussion, as far as possible, the use of technical
terms.</p>

<p class="tb">In our next sentence no change in grouping is
necessary unless we want to make a complete change
in the meaning of the language:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>3. The prisoner said the witness was a convicted thief.</p></blockquote>

<p>The apparent meaning of this sentence is its real
meaning, for its language is capable of only one construction.
If, however, the writer of the sentence
wished to convey another meaning, he could have
done so by recasting the sentence or by regrouping
it by means of marks of punctuation. If we put a
comma after “prisoner” we disconnect “prisoner”
from “said”; and the comma gives notice to the
reader that new relations for the words “prisoner”
and “said” must be sought. The only other <i>sense</i>
relations for the words are found quite automatically
the moment the eye catches the next two words,
which suggest to the reader a new group. When the
new group (said the witness) is complete, the reader
automatically cuts it off from what follows and what
precedes. Thus we have, as shown in the following
sentence, a new grouping and a new meaning:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>3-1. The prisoner, said the witness, was a convicted
thief.</p></blockquote>

<p>The meaning of voice-changes is understood by
children long before the meaning of marks of punctuation
is understood; while the full value of marks is
rarely understood, even by educated and cultured
people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>In spoken language the meaning of No. 3 is expressed
by a continuous reading with neither pause
nor voice-inflection within the sentence. The reading
of No. 3-1, in order to convey its meaning to another
person, requires quite a different voice process, which
may be represented diagrammatically:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>3-2. The prisoner <span class="h">said the witnes</span>was a convicted thief.</p>
<p><span class="h">3-2. The prisoner</span>said the witness<span class="h">s a convicted thief.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>An analysis of one’s process of reading silently,
that is, to himself, will show that, in reading No. 3-1,
he takes note of the commas and their meanings (disconnecting
and regrouping), just as he takes note,
when reading aloud, of the group depressed (written
in a line below) in No. 3-2.</p>

<p>To obtain the real meaning of this sentence when
reading silently, he reads it <i>commatically</i>; to impart
the meaning when reading aloud, he reads it <i>inflectionally</i>.</p>

<p class="tb">Our next illustrative sentence and its variations
are not much unlike the sentences just considered; but
the relations between some of the words in them are
not quite so familiar to young readers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>4. Boys like Henry never fail in school.</p></blockquote>

<p>The meaning of this sentence is unmistakable, and
at no point within it is a mark of punctuation even
suggested; but in a similarly formed sentence doubt
as to the meaning may arise:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>4-1. Boys like men may be courageous for principle’s
sake.</p></blockquote>

<p>“Like Henry” in No. 4 suggests some distinguishing
quality that Henry is known to possess,—for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
instance, <i>diligence</i>. Then, “boys like Henry” means
“diligent boys.” But “like men” suggests no particular
qualities ascribed to boys; and therefore, if
the term “like men” is not applicable to or intended
for “boys,” we cut it off by commas. Thus an
<i>apparent</i> relation is shown not to be the <i>real</i> relation;
and therefore we must regroup the words, seeking the
new meaning through our knowledge of the meaning
of language thus regrouped. The regrouped sentence
will read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>4-2. Boys, like men, may be courageous for principle’s
sake.</p></blockquote>

<p>Regrouping of this kind cannot be automatically
made by a writer, or automatically apprehended by
a reader, until the meanings of both the unpunctuated
and the punctuated language are perfectly familiar
to the writer or the reader. One’s familiarity with
language need not be purely technical to make it accurate
and thorough; but we cannot readily discuss
the language of our illustrative sentences without using
some technical (grammatical) terms.</p>

<p>“Like men” in No. 4-1 is an adjective, and is in
the natural position of an adjective of this kind. “Like
men” in No. 4-2 is an adverb, and is out of its natural
position, thus readily giving rise to a wrong grouping
of the words in the sentence. To prevent such wrong
grouping, commas are used; and they will be used by
a writer quite automatically when the purpose and
effect of such use are understood.</p>

<p>The use of most of the marks of punctuation
should become as automatic as is the spelling of most
words; but some parts of each art become automatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
only after much study. The similarity between some
of the difficulties presented by the arts of spelling and
of punctuation seems worthy of notice at this point
in our discussion. To spell the word pronounced
<i>pâr</i>, one must know whether he is to spell the name
of a fruit (pear), two things of a kind (pair), or the
act of cutting (pare). Likewise, to punctuate language
one must first know what relations exist between
the parts of language. Every group of words, as
well as every word, sustains some relation to another
word or group of words in the sentence or paragraph.
Somewhat exact knowledge of this relation is possessed
by everybody, even by the child just beginning to
talk. It is a part of one’s common sense; but, unfortunately,
many text-books on language, used in the
grade school, the high school, and the college, bury
the common-sense knowledge of the pupil under
technicalities that are never mastered. In like manner
the technicalities of punctuation have made the
art so difficult that it may be said to be almost a lost
art. We are attempting to rediscover it through our
common sense.</p>

<p>Let the reader challenge the first comma, when he
reaches it, in No. 4-2 with “What do you say?”
The answer will be, “Reader, if you think ‘like men’
is an adjective describing ‘boys,’ as ‘like Henry’ describes
‘boys’ in No. 4, you are mistaken, and you
must look for another meaning.” A like challenge of
the second comma, if necessary, will elicit this answer:
“Reader, if you think ‘men’ is the subject of ‘may,’
you are mistaken, and you must look for another
meaning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p>That the use of the commas in No. 4-2 is practically
the same as their use in No. 3-1, may also be
illustrated diagrammatically:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>4-3. Boys <span class="h">like me</span>may be courageous for principle’s sake.</p>
<p> <span class="h">4-3. Boys</span>like men<span class="h">may be courageous for principle’s sake.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>There is another and very important class of
words whose sense relation is determined by the punctuation
we have been considering. We shall merely
touch upon this punctuation at this time, leaving it
for fuller discussion later.</p>

<p>As the context is often necessary to show the real
meaning of a word, we will supply it for our first
example.</p>

<p>In response to a request to be excused from school,
a teacher informs a pupil that he may go later. At a
later hour the teacher says to him:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>5. Now you may go.</p></blockquote>

<p>The word “now” is here expressive purely of time,
and suggests no other meaning than that obtained at
the first reading. The sentence is another form of
“You may go now,” which requires no punctuation
other than the period. The word “now,” as here
used, is an adverb expressing time.</p>

<p>In a similarly formed sentence the office of the
word may be quite different; and, in order to show
this fact, the comma is used.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>5-1. Now we see we that cannot learn to punctuate
until we comprehend the fundamental principles underlying
the relations between groups of words, as well as the
fundamental principles underlying the use of marks.
Now, what are we going to do about it?</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p>In No. 5-1 the first “now” conveys a sufficient
idea of time to stand as an adverb, just as “now” does
in No. 5; but the second “now” is a mere expletive.
To show that it does not sustain its <i>apparent</i> relation,
the relation of time, to the remainder of the clause, it
is cut off by a comma.</p>

<p class="center" style="page-break-before: always;">RECAPITULATION</p>

<p>Let us now review and recapitulate the points we
have tried to establish in our study thus far:</p>

<p>1. The meaning of language depends very largely
upon the groupings of its words. In very simple
language, words are so placed that each word is
related to a word or words immediately or closely
following or preceding it. In such language the reader
is hardly conscious that the words are grouped,
except into sentences; and no mark may be required,
except the end-mark.</p>

<p>2. In more complex language the grouping within
the sentence becomes manifest to the reader, and two
constructions and two meanings of the language often
become possible. In order to notify the reader which
meaning the language is intended to convey, the
writer may put a sign-board at the point where the
meaning may be mistaken. The reader reads the
sign-board, and thus keeps on the right line of
thought-development.</p>

<p>3. In the sentences thus far studied, except No.
3-1, marks were used simply to aid the reader to
catch the meaning quickly by avoiding a wrong
grouping of words. In No. 3-1 the meaning of the
language was entirely changed by the marks.</p>

<p class="center"><small>[Examples will be found at the end of Chapter II]</small></p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;"><small><b>CHAPTER II</b></small><br /><br />

THE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE OF
PUNCTUATION—GROUPING</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> endeavored to show in Chapter I that the
fundamental purpose of punctuation is to group by
means of marks words whose relations in the absence
of marks would be either easily mistaken or not
quickly apprehended.</p>

<p>When to use a mark, and what mark to use, are
determined by <i>reason</i> or by <i>convention</i>.</p>

<p>Some of the <i>conventions</i> that determine a punctuation
familiar to most people, together with some
of the problems that confront us in our study, are
exhibited in the punctuation of the following sentence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>5A. Mr. Smith came to the city in 1872, and located
at 1872 Wabash Avenue. He brought with him 1,872 horses,
valued at $187,200.00.</p></blockquote>

<p>How does punctuation enable the reader to obtain
the meaning at one point in the above sentence, and
so to group the language (figures) at another point
that he can apprehend the meaning at a glance?
Because of well-nigh universal usage, the above <i>date</i>
and <i>street</i> numbers are read <i>eighteen hundred seventy-two</i>;
but the same number in the next sentence is read
<i>one thousand eight hundred seventy-two</i>. As we all
know, in arithmetical notation three figures form a
group, the groups so formed being named <i>units</i>, <i>thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>sands</i>,
<i>millions</i>, etc. It is therefore evident that, in
reading a number containing two or more such groups,
the eye will be aided if the groups are indicated by
some mark. (We here use the comma and the period
for this purpose.) Although the left-hand group of a
number may not be full, a figure in that group takes
the name of the group, and so we mark it off. Thus
we use commas in two of the numbers in our example,
one of which (1,872) has only one figure in the second
(thousand) group. This we call punctuation by
reason, for we thus point off natural groups.</p>

<p>We do not use the comma to group the figures in
the same number (1872) used in two other places in
the above example. Because date and street numbers
of four figures are read in groups of two figures
each the eye readily does the grouping, and a mark is
not needed as an aid in the grouping. This is also
punctuation by reason.</p>

<p>In the fourth number in our example we use a
comma to do one grouping, and a period to make
another (the cents) group. We call the use of the
period in this number <i>conventional</i> punctuation.</p>

<p>Many printing-offices do not punctuate a number
containing less than five figures. Such a rule would
call for 9999 and 10,000. This is purely arbitrary
punctuation. Our problem is to find, as far as possible,
a reason for the use of every mark, and to point
out what seems to us good conventional usage in
punctuation for which we can find no reason.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">THE NAMES OF MARKS</h3>

<p>The names of the principal marks were given to
them by the Greek grammarians, the name of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
mark being the name of the group of words with
which the mark was used. The group of words which
we call a <i>sentence</i>, they called a <i>period</i>. They arbitrarily
marked its end by a dot, and called the dot also
a “period.” We retain the name of the mark. They
called one of the largest divisions of a sentence a
<i>limb</i>, and set it off with a mark called the “kolon,”
which means a limb. We retain the name of the mark
in our word colon. The same is true of the mark we
still call a <i>comma</i>. The <i>semicolon</i> is a mark of later
date; and, as its name implies, it falls between the
comma and the colon in its character and use.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">THE RELATIVE VALUES OF MARKS</h3>

<p>We still recognize, at least in large measure, the
values given the marks by the Greek grammarians;
and the principle is important in our study. Thus
we say, of the four principal marks the comma indicates
the slightest degree of separation between groups
of words within a sentence; the semicolon indicates
the next larger division; and the colon indicates the
largest division. The period separates a full sentence
from the sentence standing next to it; and it is also
used when a sentence stands alone.</p>

<p class="tb">We have seen the need of marks in the above
illustrative sentences, and have also seen <i>where</i> the
marks were needed; but we had to <i>assume</i> that the
comma was the proper mark to use. We now know
the relative values given the marks by the Greek
grammarians. If our knowledge of language, even
though it is not based upon technical grammar, teaches
us that the degree of separation between the groups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
of words where we found the need of a mark, was the
least degree requiring a mark, then the comma was the
proper mark to use. With this relative degree of
separation in language and the relative value of the
comma intelligently settled, we can assert that we
punctuated our illustrative sentences in Chapter I by
<i>reason</i>, and not by <i>rule</i>. An apparent exception to
the exact truth of this statement is presented in the
punctuation of Sentence 1-1, because the degree of
separation between its parts cannot be exactly fixed.
We discuss this point in Chapters IV and VII.</p>

<p>A sentence exhibiting the relations calling for the
use of the four principal marks will serve to show
their relative values, and the relative degrees of
separation between groups of words which the marks
indicate:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>6. Athens’ freedom and her power have, for more
than twenty centuries, been annihilated; her people have
degenerated into timid slaves; her language, into a barbarous
jargon; her temples have been given up to the
successive depredations of Romans, Turks, and Scotchmen:
but her intellectual empire is imperishable.</p></blockquote>

<p>Reading this sentence with the knowledge of the
comma already gained, we reach the end of the first
fairly complete group of words, where we meet a semicolon.
Let us challenge this mark, or sign-board, for
its meaning. In answer, it says that what is to follow
is not to be tied in the <i>comma</i> relation to what has
preceded, as would be the case if the sentence continued
in the following way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>6-1. Athens’ freedom and her power have, for more
than twenty centuries, been annihilated, her people having
degenerated through luxury.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>The semicolon, on the contrary, says that the
group of words to follow is of equal rank with the
whole group which has preceded the mark; and it thus
shows how the sentence is to develop. The next
semicolon in No. 6 says to the reader that a series of
semicolon-divided groups is under way. This makes
easy reading up to the colon, which, being followed
by “but,” is to mark the <i>extent</i> of the <i>but</i> relation
between what is to follow and what has preceded.
The meaning of the colon, as learned from its original
use, tells the reader that the sentence is divided into
members, or “limbs”; and therefore the <i>but</i> relation
here is between all that precedes and all that is
to follow, for these groups constitute the limbs of the
sentence. If what follows the colon was to be tied
to less than all that precedes, the <i>but</i> relation could
extend only to the last semicolon, thus completing
this particular group. It is very evident that the
<i>but</i> relation could not terminate in the midst of
language tied together as are the groups preceding
“but” in this sentence; and yet many good writers use
the semicolon, instead of the colon, in sentences like
this, probably, however, without considering what
grouping is thus made.</p>

<p>The entire sentence is divided into two groups by
the colon, as the sense relation manifestly requires.
If we change the order of the two larger groups in No.
6, the colon will be the first mark reached by the
reader; and it will give him notice of what is to follow:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>6-2. Athens’ intellectual empire is imperishable:
but her freedom and her powers have, for more than twenty
centuries, been annihilated ...</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>Here the colon, if challenged for its meaning,
would say that all that follows it in the sentence is
to form one group in the <i>but</i> relation to all that precedes,
with the further information that what follows
is to be divided into groups by semicolons, thus requiring
the colon to divide the sentence into two
main parts. A semicolon at this point would have
given another reply, and would not have been followed
by other semicolons.</p>

<p>Probably the beginner in the study of punctuation
will not fully comprehend this discussion of Sentence
6 and its modifications; but the discussion may throw
some additional light on the <i>disjunctive</i> and <i>grouping</i>
office of the four marks, including the period at the
end of the sentence.</p>

<p class="tb">We will now consider a sentence in which the
grouping, with its consequent punctuation, is at once
very simple and very subtle. It is subtle because it
is based upon the subtle meanings of the language;
and yet it becomes very simple when the language is
understood:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>7. The following are the names of the Deity and of
Jesus Christ:</p>

<p>1. Jehovah, Lord, God Almighty; Creator, Father,
Preserver, Governor; the Supreme Being; the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>2. The Messiah, the Anointed; the Son, the Savior,
the Redeemer; the Holy One; Prophet, Teacher, Master;
Judge of the World.</p></blockquote>

<p>Commas would be sufficient here to indicate what
word or group of words constitutes a name; but there
is additional information in the grouping of names
which the writer desires to convey, and which, per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>haps,
would not appear to many readers if attention
were not directed to it by proper grouping, which is
done here by semicolons. It will be seen that the
number of names in a group in the above example
varies from one to four.</p>

<p>What information does this grouping convey, and
upon what is the grouping based? The words in the
first group are the primary terms for the Deity (Exodus
vi, 2, 3); in the second group, the names of the
Deity which express His relation to man; etc.</p>

<p>The next sentence shows a similar grouping, but
a grouping based upon more familiar and more marked
characteristics of the things grouped:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>7-1. Among the chief products of Minnesota are the
following: wheat, corn, and oats; potatoes, beets, beans,
etc.; butter and cheese; lumber; iron; etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>The semicolon grouping here needs no explanation,
although the use of a mark at one point in the
sentence may seem at variance with the punctuation
at another point. In the second group a comma is
used before “etc.”; and at the end of the sentence a
semicolon precedes “etc.” The punctuation is consistent
with the uses of the two marks in other parts
of the sentence. In the second group the comma
says the <i>group</i> is not complete; and therefore “etc.”
stands for unexpressed items of the group, such, for
instance, as <i>peas</i>. The last semicolon indicates to
the reader that there are other groups; for instance,
<i>cattle, sheep, and hogs</i> might constitute a group.</p>

<p>Many readers pass over punctuation of this kind;
and they do not understand, or seek to understand,
the meaning of such grouping as that in No. 7, while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
because of its simplicity, that in No. 7-1 scarcely
attracts their attention.</p>

<p class="tb">In the next sentence the grouping is informing and
somewhat striking. The sentence, with a slight modification,
is taken from a U. S. Census Report:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>7-2. I have the honor to transmit herewith statistical
tables of mortality; the insane, feeble-minded, deaf
and dumb, and blind; crime, pauperism, and benevolence;
education; churches; foreign-born population; and manufactures.</p></blockquote>

<p>The third group in this sentence is particularly
striking, for it suggests the relationship between
crime and pauperism, and the consequent private
effort, in the form of benevolence, to deal with a
social condition with which every government must
deal.</p>

<p>Thus in Sentence 7-2 the grouping by semicolons
imparts information which might be readily overlooked.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">PUNCTUATION OF A SERIES</h3>

<p>Sentence 7-2 suggests two uses of the comma to
be found in the simplest sentences, one of which uses
we almost take for granted, and the other is a mooted
use. Why do we use the comma between nouns
standing together? and why do we omit it before the
first “and,” and use it before the next “and,” in the
second group (the insane, feeble-minded, deaf and
dumb, and blind)?</p>

<p>We answer that each use is based upon the fundamental
principle of punctuation, the principle of
<i>disjunction</i>, which distinguishes between the <i>apparent</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
and the <i>real</i> meaning of words or groups of words
standing together.</p>

<p>It may be said, with apparent good reason, that
no comma is absolutely necessary to separate the
second and third nouns in such a group as “wheat,
corn, and oats”; and it is quite common practice not
to use a comma before the final “and” in such a
group. While this practice may be correct, it is to be
remembered that we are seeking helpful punctuation,
not the absolutely necessary in each instance; and the
most helpful punctuation is that which is most nearly
uniform in its treatment of cases falling into well-defined
classes.</p>

<p>As we are now considering what is technically
called a <i>series</i>, it is well to consider the value of consistency
in the punctuation of a series. A few examples
will illustrate this point:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>8. William Henry and James are at school.</p></blockquote>

<p>The words in the above stand in the natural order
and relations to express thought in almost the simplest
form of language. “William” is a noun sustaining
to “Henry” the adjective relation, just as it would
do in the name <i>William Smith</i>, even though our
grammars give it another relation. If we do not wish
it to stand in this relation and to convey this meaning,
we disconnect the two words by a comma:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>8-1. William, Henry and James are at school.</p></blockquote>

<p>This sentence names three boys; and its meaning
is unmistakable at a glance.</p>

<p>We saw in Sentence 1 the tendency of the reader
to combine in one group words connected by “and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>”
which is the natural manner of reading. Because of
this fact, notice is to be given by punctuation when
“and” does not connect the words between which it
stands, unless notice is given in another way, as it
often is. As Sentence 8-1 is written, “Henry and
James” appears to constitute a group to be followed
by other words in a series, just as is the case in the
second group of No. 7-2. This tendency to wrong
grouping will be seen in reading the following sentence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>8-2. Among the earliest colleges established in
America were Yale, Trinity, William and Mary, and
Harvard.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this sentence one college (William and Mary) is
named by a group of words connected by “and,”
this group being followed by another name also connected
by “and” to what precedes. All punctuators
admit that such grouping imperatively demands a
comma before the final “and,” for without the comma
the reader could not possibly ascertain from the
language the names of the colleges.</p>

<p>As such grouping is very common, and as the
tendency to group together words connected by “and”
is quite natural, the use of the comma before the final
“and” in every series is <i>helpful</i> punctuation. This
punctuation makes the absence of the comma before
“and” give notice that a group of words within, and
not at the end of, the series, is reached. For this
reason it is well to make the punctuation of every
series uniform.</p>

<p>This punctuation requires a comma before “and”
in No. 8-1:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>8-3. William, Henry, and James are at school.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>Unless one, in reading aloud, exhibits the grouping
by voice-inflection, his hearers may not comprehend
the meaning conveyed by the grouping. Failure
thus to show the grouping in No. 8-2 would utterly
confuse the hearer as to the names of the two colleges
designated by a group of words in which two “ands”
appear. This relation between voice-inflection and
punctuation is considered in our discussion of Sentence
28 and its variations.</p>

<p>A possible and apparent exception to the punctuation
exhibited in No. 8-3 may be demanded in the
punctuation of a very familiar group of words, the
address line of a speech:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>8-4. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen.</p></blockquote>

<p>The voice-inflection of almost every speaker who
uses these words, as well as of almost every person who
reads them aloud, exhibits a grouping that inhibits
the use of a comma before “and.” In other words,
the people addressed by the speaker are divided into
two groups,—the “president” constituting one group,
and “ladies and gentlemen” another. This grouping
is exhibited by the voice-inflection of the speaker or
reader and by the omission of a comma before “and”
by the printer.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, three groups are to be made
of the persons addressed, the voice-inflection and the
punctuation (a comma before “and”) should show
the grouping.</p>

<p>In the absence of a comma before “and” in this
group, the language of the group does not constitute
what we technically call a “series”; and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
the omission of the comma is only an <i>apparent</i>
exception to the punctuation of a series.</p>

<p>We call attention to the punctuation of this group
of words because we find it in the two Manuals issued
by the University of Chicago Press. It is there
printed without an explanation of the omission of the
comma, although such omission is contrary to the rule
given in each Manual for the punctuation of a series,
while the words appear in another place in one of the
Manuals with a comma before “and.” The words
appear in the Manuals as illustrations of the use of
capitals and italics, and not in connection with
punctuation.</p>

<p>It may be well to recall that the relation between
any two words or groups of words in a series is the
relation shown by the final conjunction. If expressed,
this conjunction is either “and” or “or”; if not expressed,
it is practically always “and.”</p>

<p>It is a quite common practice to use a comma
before the final “and” in a series requiring semicolons
between the preceding groups. This punctuation
often leaves the reader in doubt as to whether the
“and” completes a group or ends the series; therefore
the better punctuation is to use a semicolon
before the final “and” in such a series.</p>

<p>The value of grouping is further shown in the
following sentence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>9. There are no better cosmetics than temperance
and purity, modesty and humility, a gracious temper
and calmness of spirit.</p></blockquote>

<p>We group the words in this sentence for the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
reason that the words are grouped in Nos. 7, 7-1,
and 7-2. It is simply natural grouping based upon
the sense of the language.</p>

<p>How much would be lost in the absence of such
grouping may be seen by breaking up the simple
groups in No. 9:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>9-1. There are no better cosmetics than temperance,
purity, modesty, humility, a gracious temper, and
calmness of spirit.</p></blockquote>

<p>The punctuation of No. 9-1 is just as correct as
that of No. 9; but it is purely mechanical and not
“elegant.” Forceful grouping, with or without grouping
words, requires proper punctuation.</p>

<p>Another quite simple form of this grouping, based
upon the sense relation, is sometimes overlooked by
distinguished writers, and even by authors of text-books
on language. The following sentence exhibits
both a correct grouping and a correct sense relation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>10. He is in doubt about the best course for him to
pursue; but I am sure about the best course for me to
pursue.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here the <i>but</i> relation is between <i>his doubt</i> and <i>my
certainty</i>, as if written, <i>He is in doubt; but I am sure</i>.</p>

<p>A similarly formed sentence may convey a meaning
that is clearly not the meaning the writer wishes
to convey:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>10-1. He is in doubt about the best course for him
to pursue; but I am sure his doubt will soon disappear.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <i>but</i> relation in No. 10-1 is not between <i>his
doubt</i> and <i>my certainty</i>, as in No. 10. The meaning
of No. 10-1 may be expressed thus: <i>He is in doubt;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
but his doubt will soon disappear</i>. But the assertion
made in the latter part of this statement is too strong,
and requires a modifier. “Probably” would nearly
express the meaning intended to be expressed by the
modifier in No. 10-1. If “I am sure” is preferred as
the modifier, its relation to the verb (will disappear)
must be made unmistakable. It is not so made in
No. 10-1, for it appears to be connected by “but”
with what precedes it, just as it is connected with what
precedes it in No. 10. To disconnect it, a comma
precedes it; and one follows it to disconnect it from
what follows.</p>

<p>The new relations are shown by the following
punctuation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>10-2. He is in doubt about the best course for him
to pursue; but, I am sure, his doubt will soon disappear.</p></blockquote>

<p>Suppose the sentence read as follows, how would
it be punctuated?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>10-3. He is in doubt about the best course for him
to pursue; but I am sure that his doubt will soon disappear.</p></blockquote>

<p>This sentence cannot be punctuated. The <i>but</i>
relation is here between incongruous thoughts; and
therefore the sentence must be mended, which can
be done by making it like No. 10-2, omitting “that.”</p>

<p>No amount of usage, even among good writers,
can justify the absence of commas in No. 10-1, or
the construction of No. 10-3.</p>

<p>The discussion of these sentences emphasizes the
necessity for observing the meaning of language as
expressed by its grouping and by the relation of one
group to another.</p>

relations already discussed if we consider them from

permits no other grouping. Thus the meaning of No. 18 is,
that Tennyson was accompanied by a dog and a person (one of
his boys or a friend).</p>

MODIFIED PARENTHESIS, EXPLANATORY
AND RESTRICTIVE TERMS, AFTER-THOUGHT,
AND APPOSITIVES</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">EXPLANATORY AND RESTRICTIVE MODIFIERS</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Greek grammarians gave the name <i>parenthesis</i>
to a group of words “thrust into” language, either
spoken or written, when such words have no <i>grammatical</i>
connection with the language. We retain the
word “parenthesis” to describe such a group, and also
as the name of the curved lines with which the group
is enclosed and thus identified. These lines are called
<i>parenthesis</i>, <i>marks of parenthesis</i>, or <i>parentheses</i>.</p>

<p>Such matter is inserted for explanation or qualification;
but it is not essential to the meaning of the
language into which it is thrust, for matter essential
to the meaning would not be so named or so marked.</p>

<p>The parenthesis did the ancient writers a larger
service in the involved style of their composition than
it does modern writers; however, in a modified form,
it does the modern writer a very useful and, at times,
an indispensable service.</p>

<p>What we may call a <i>modified parenthesis</i> (modified
parenthetical matter) is found, one or more times, in
almost every paragraph.</p>

<p>In order to clarify or explain our adopted term,
“modified parenthesis,” a parenthesis, enclosed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
parentheses, was used in the sentence preceding this
one; and, in the same sentence, in order to qualify, in
a somewhat peculiar manner, the expression “is found
in every paragraph,” the modified parenthetical group
of words “one or more times” was inserted. We
characterize this parenthesis as <i>somewhat peculiar</i>. In
its literal meaning, “one or more times” adds nothing
to the statement in which it appears, for whatever occurs
must occur “one or more times.” It does, however,
add a new and perhaps subtle thought as to the
frequency of the occurrence of the parenthesis.</p>

<p>The meanings of these terms, together with the
reasons for their punctuation, will appear as we discuss
illustrative examples:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>11. The author says (page 5) that he did not go to
London.</p></blockquote>

<p>The words “page 5” were inserted in the above
sentence by the writer himself simply as a matter of
direction to the place in the book where the assertion
was made. It has no grammatical connection with
any part of the sentence: it is simply “thrust in”—it
is “parenthetical.” We may modify its strictly
parenthetical nature by putting it in another form:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>11-1. The author says, on page 5, that he did not go
to London.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here the expression “on page 5” has still the parenthetical
nature; but it is given grammatical connection,
by means of the preposition “on,” to what precedes
it. Thus we call it a “modified parenthesis”; or we
may call it “slightly parenthetical” matter. It is
obvious that the expression can be omitted in either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
No. 11 or No. 11-1 without the slightest effect upon
the meaning of the sentence.</p>

<p>If we omit the commas in No. 11-1, we give the
sentence practically a new meaning; and to complete
the meaning a new clause must be added:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>11-2. The author says on page 5 that he did not go
to London; but he says on page 6 that he did go to London.</p></blockquote>

<p>In No. 11-2 the language is used in its natural
order; and no mark is required in either clause, for
each group of words has its natural or logical relation
to the group or groups standing next to it. The
meaning is unmistakable. But why was the comma
used in No. 11-1 and not in No. 11-2? Let us note
carefully that we are still dealing with the proper
grouping of words and with the relations of group to
group, such relations giving rise to <i>real</i> and <i>apparent</i>
meanings. With the real meaning of such groups
as we are now considering fully understood, we know
that a mark is used to change that meaning. Thus,
in the consideration of these sentences, we come back
to the principle exemplified in Sentences 1 and 2. We
use the commas in No. 11-1 because the real meaning
of the sentence is not the same as the meaning
of the same language in No. 11-2.</p>

<p>One or two illustrative sentences will lead us,
gradually and logically, to the punctuation of a large
class of sentences in which the groups of words considered
have somewhat more definite names than we
have given the same groups in the above sentences.</p>

<p>A thorough comprehension of this punctuation is
often indispensable, that the writer may convey to
the reader his exact meaning, which may depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
entirely upon the punctuation,—that is, upon the
<i>absence</i> or the <i>presence</i> of marks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>12. Everywhere in America and England, as well as
in Germany, the cry for peace is heard.</p></blockquote>

<p>What does the language of No. 12 mean? Clearly,
that in every part (everywhere) of America and in
every part of England, as well as in every part of
Germany, the cry for peace is heard. That is the
<i>apparent</i>, and it is also the <i>real</i>, meaning of the
language; but the writer may have had a different
meaning in mind. If he did not wish to limit the
“cry for peace” to America, England, and Germany,
he would have disconnected from “everywhere” these
limiting words, writing the sentence thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>12-1. Everywhere, in America and England, as well
as in Germany, the cry for peace is heard.</p></blockquote>

<p>The use of the first comma in this grouping notifies
the reader that a grouping different from the apparent
grouping must be made. It also notifies him that a
meaning different from that of No. 12 is to be conveyed
by the new grouping. The second comma
readily falls into its place; and by the same reasoning
the third comma is called for.</p>

<p>The two groups are slightly parenthetical; and,
treated as one group, they could be set off by parentheses.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>12-2. Everywhere (in America and England, as well
as in Germany) the cry for peace is heard.</p></blockquote>

<p>They are not <i>properly</i> included in marks of parenthesis,
because they do not constitute a pure parenthesis.
They are inserted, not to explain the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
“everywhere,” but for emphasis, being equivalent
in meaning to <i>even in America</i>, etc. It will be observed
that “everywhere,” as here used, means in all
parts of the world. Nothing can be added to it; and
therefore what the group of words under consideration
explains is, that the word is used in its inclusive
and exact meaning. The marks give a shade of
meaning somewhat similar to that given by commas
in setting off “one or more times,” discussed above.</p>

<p>It may be noted, in passing, that the middle (the
second) comma in No. 12-1 acts with the first comma
to form one group and with the third comma to form
another group, thus making the three commas equivalent
to two pairs of commas.</p>

<p class="tb">Our next sentence is an exceedingly interesting
one. It has been submitted for interpretation to
a number of persons, including editorial writers, authors,
teachers, lawyers, and printers. Not a single
one of them saw the real meaning; and, when the
meaning was pointed out, not one of them could explain
why the commas are used. Moreover, not one
of the score or more of text-books on punctuation at
hand gives a satisfactory explanation. The rules of
all the books, it is true, cover the point; but the application
of the rules is often so difficult as to render
them valueless.</p>

<p>When understood, the sentence is simplicity itself,
and the punctuation becomes equally simple and
very informing.</p>

<p>The sentence (No. 13) is a part of a larger sentence
taken from an essay on “Literature and Education” by
Dr. Henry van Dyke, the larger sentence being one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
several directions how to determine the value of a
story:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>13. Ask whether the people in the story develop, for
better or for worse.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us suggest that the reader study the sentence
before proceeding with our discussion of it. Let him
put the sentence in the form of a question, and apply
it to any story he has recently read. What two
answers could be given to the question if applied to
two stories requiring different answers?</p>

<p>Now let us ask why the comma is used. The
answer is simple, for in our study of marks we have
had only <i>one</i> reason for using the comma,—namely,
to show that an <i>apparent</i> meaning is not the <i>real</i>
meaning. If this is the reason for the use of the
comma, the reason will be exemplified by a study of
the sentence without the comma:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>13-1. Ask whether the people in the story develop
for better or for worse.</p></blockquote>

<p>If the meaning of each sentence is not yet clear,
let us consider the group of words following the
comma in No. 13 as slightly parenthetical (a modified
parenthesis). We may go a step further, and treat
them as purely parenthetical, putting them in marks
of parenthesis and putting the sentence in the interrogative
form:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>13-2. Do the people in the story develop (for better
or for worse)?</p></blockquote>

<p>Manifestly, the only answer is <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i>.</p>

<p>Why did Dr. van Dyke add these slightly parenthetical
and apparently superfluous words (for better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
or for worse) to his sentence? He added them,
primarily, because he knew some, perhaps many,
readers might think “develop” means only growth
upward (for better), while it is just as essential for
the novelist to depict characters that “develop”
<i>downward</i> (for worse) as <i>upward</i>.</p>

<p>But what does No. 13-1 mean? If put in the
form of a question, what answer can be given? Only
“for better” or “for worse.” This changes the meaning
of the language. The first sentence (No. 13) asks
whether the people in the story are static or dynamic;
the second (No. 13-1) assumes that they are dynamic
(they develop), and asks in what direction they
develop.</p>

<p>Dr. van Dyke’s entire sentence clearly shows the
meaning of the part of it we have been considering.
The sentence is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>13-3. Ask whether the people in the story develop,
for better or for worse, and how far the change is credible
and significant.</p></blockquote>

<p>The groups of words we have been considering in
Sentences 11 to 13-3 are either <i>restrictive</i> or <i>explanatory</i>
groups, with the functions of nouns, adjectives,
or adverbs, and with the relations that these parts
of speech take in the construction of language.</p>

<p>The meanings of the terms “restrictive” and “explanatory”
will appear as we consider other sentences;
and the differentiation in the punctuation of restrictive
and explanatory groups will be plain.</p>

<p class="tb">Our next sentence will serve a twofold purpose:
first, to show how difficult it is to punctuate a sen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>tence
out of its context; and, secondly, to show that a
sentence may be given two meanings by punctuation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>14. The boy who is at home is my best pupil.</p>

<p>14-1. The boy, who is at home, is my best pupil.</p></blockquote>

<p>The person who is thoroughly familiar with the
<i>reasons</i> for the use of marks can interpret these
sentences; and he can also construct a context requiring
the commas or their omission. On the other
hand, one not familiar with such reasons could
probably do neither.</p>

<p>The value of this knowledge is quite inestimable.
Because of ignorance of it on the part of legislators,
our courts have been required to determine the meanings
of municipal, state, and national laws involving
vital social relations and vast financial interests.</p>

<p>Applying the general principles already discussed,
we say that the first comma in No. 14-1 is to show
that the relation between “boy” and “who is my best
pupil” is not the same relation that exists between
the same groups in No. 14. But why is this? Let us
construct contexts for the sentences, and then study
them in the light of the information thus obtained.</p>

<p>Suppose a visitor to a school asks the teacher
about a certain class, and the teacher replies as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>14-2. The class is composed of six boys. The boy
who is at home is my best pupil.</p></blockquote>

<p>The group of words “who is at home” is an adjective;
and the meaning of the noun with the qualification
made by the adjective may be thus expressed:
<i>the at-home boy</i>. In this form the group specifies
<i>what</i> boy, and so <i>restricts</i> the boy named as to mean
a certain, definite boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>We here take the language in its natural order,
and obtain a definite and clearly understood meaning.</p>

<p>Another context will show a different relation.
The teacher replies as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>14-3. The class is composed of one boy and five girls.
The boy, who is at home, is my best pupil.</p></blockquote>

<p>Because of the context, “the boy” needs no identification,
no restrictive words to explain who is
meant. The sentence could be written thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>14-4. The class is composed of one boy and five
girls. The boy (he is at home) is my best pupil.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the above sentence the group of words in parentheses
<i>explains</i>; but it is not <i>restrictive</i>. It tells something
about the boy; but it does not tell <i>what</i> boy, for
this information is given in what precedes, which says
there is only one boy. In No. 14-3 this group of
words is slightly changed, and is given grammatical
connection by its form, and thus it becomes only
<i>slightly</i> parenthetical.</p>

<p>In Nos. 14 and 14-2 the meaning is not complete
without the <i>restrictive</i> words. In Nos. 14-1, 14-3,
and 14-4 these words are not essential to identify the
boy, being added simply by way of explanation, hence
they are called <i>explanatory</i>.</p>

<p>In the consideration of the terms <i>explanatory</i>
and <i>restrictive</i>, much confusion arises from the
fact that a restrictive group may also be an explanatory
group. A purely <i>explanatory</i> group, which
requires commas to set it off, is never a <i>restrictive</i>
group. This confusion can be entirely avoided by
calling the groups <i>restrictive</i> and <i>non-restrictive</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
latter group is set off by commas because it conveys
a different meaning from that of a restrictive group,
and also because it is “slightly parenthetical,” that is,
parenthetical in nature, but with grammatical connection.</p>

<p>Not a few writers use the marks of parenthesis or
dashes, instead of commas, to set off a non-restrictive
(explanatory) group; but, as their writings reveal no
differentiation in the uses of these three marks, their
system of punctuation is a wholly hit-or-miss one.</p>

<p class="tb">Because of the extent and importance of restrictive
and non-restrictive groups of words, another like
illustrative sentence, with its variations, seems worth
while:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>15. The committee is composed of women who are
not voters.</p>

<p>15-1. The committee is composed of women, who
are not voters.</p>

<p>15-2. The committee is composed of men who are
not voters.</p>

<p>15-3. The committee is composed of men, who are
not voters.</p></blockquote>

<p>What do these sentences really assert and what
meanings do they convey? Let us consider the
answers to this question quite fully, and make them
a test of all restrictive and non-restrictive groups.</p>

<p>No. 15 says the members of the committee are not
voters, implying that other women are voters. The
members of the committee might not be voters because
of age, non-residence, etc.</p>

<p>No. 15-1 says all women are not voters,—that
is, no women are voters. The group “who are not
voters” is explanatory of women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>No. 15-2 is the same as No. 15.</p>

<p>No. 15-3 is the same as No. 15-1; but, as men
enjoy universal political suffrage, the statement in
No. 15-3 is somewhat more striking than that made
in No. 15-1, and therefore we must seek conditions
giving sanction to such an assertion. For instance,
a woman’s society might admit men to honorary
membership in the society without the privilege of
voting. If a committee was composed of such men,
the statement made in No. 15-3 would be applicable.</p>

<p class="tb">Our next three sentences are perhaps more typical
of the sentences met in general reading:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>16. In 1826, an edition of this work, designed solely
for printers, was first published.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Teall quotes the above sentence, among
others from books on punctuation, and says that the
commas setting off “designed solely for printers”
should be omitted.</p>

<p>The sentence is from a late edition of Mr. Wilson’s
work; and it shows that author’s discriminating use
of marks. The omission of the commas would
entirely change the meaning of the language. The
meaning of the language may be more clearly expressed
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>16-1. In 1826, the first edition of this work was published,
and was designed solely for printers.</p></blockquote>

<p>With the commas omitted the meaning of the
sentence would be as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>16-2. In 1826, the first edition of this work designed
solely for printers, was published.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p>Sentences 16 and 16-1 say that the first edition of
the work was published in 1826. Sentence 16, with
the commas omitted, as Mr. Teall says they should
be, and Sentence 16-2 say the first <i>printers’</i> edition
was published in 1826; and they imply that other
editions not designed solely for printers were previously
published. As no such edition was published,
Mr. Teall is in error, and Mr. Wilson’s punctuation
(No. 16) is correct.</p>

<p>Many writers set off such <i>explanatory</i> or <i>slightly
parenthetical</i> modifiers by parentheses, as illustrated
in Sentence 12-2; other writers use dashes for this
purpose. As we shall show later, neither mark finds
sanction in punctuation by reason.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>17. In medicine the anesthetic of choice is chloroform
or ether; in dentistry it is laughing-gas, or nitrous
oxide.</p></blockquote>

<p>The conjunction “or” appears twice in the above
sentence. In the first clause it stands between two
words, one of which is excluded when the other is
selected, just as if written “either chloroform or
ether.” In the second clause a new relation between
the words is set up. Here the apparent meaning is
not the real meaning.</p>

<p>In this second group the words following “or” are
explanatory of the word preceding “or.” One anesthetic
with two names is spoken of. The comma
notifies the reader that the relation in the second group
is not the relation existing in the first,—that is, the
apparent relation in the second group is not the <i>real</i>
relation.</p>

<p>Many writers would put “or nitrous oxide” in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
parentheses. The meaning would be unmistakable;
but the punctuation is not commendable, as we have
already seen. “Nitrous oxide,” without the “or,”
could properly be enclosed in parentheses.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">AFTERTHOUGHT</span></p>

<p>There is a very common use of the comma before
“or” which reveals a nice meaning of language. The
punctuation grows out of a writer’s desire to modify
a meaning which he has expressed, frequently, in a
word that is too strong. He follows this word with
another in the <i>or</i> relation to the too-strong word.
In order to show that the real <i>or</i> relation, as discussed
under No. 17, does not exist between the two words,
and that the relation of explanation (slightly parenthetical),
as discussed under No. 11, is the <i>real</i> relation,
he applies the principle of disjunction, exhibited
in another form in the discussion of Sentence
1, and uses the comma.</p>

<p>In our first illustrative sentence (No. 17A) the fact
that a word of milder, not coördinate, meaning is to
follow “or,” is indicated both by the group of words
(I should say) and by the modifier (even) preceding
the word in the <i>or</i> relation to “independent.” The
comma before “or” would be required in the absence
of either or both of these modifiers, as shown in Nos.
17A-1 and 17A-2. It is especially needed in No. 17A-2
to distinguish the <i>real</i> from the <i>apparent</i> meaning:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>17A. This capital does not make him independent,
or, I should say, even aspiring.</p>

<p>17A-1. This capital does not make him independent,
or even aspiring.</p>

<p>17A-2. This capital does not make him independent,
or aspiring.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>The word or words used in modification of an
idea expressed either too strongly or too weakly, are
aptly called an “afterthought”; and such word or
words themselves suggest the parenthetical nature
of the added language.</p>

<p class="tb">Our next illustrative sentence shows the use of a
word that is too weak; and therefore the sense requires
a stronger word. The sentence is particularly
interesting because it is a type of sentences that are
almost invariably punctuated wrong, even by our
best writers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>18. It is a matter of whim, or, worse, of economy.</p></blockquote>

<p>The word “worse” is introduced to characterize
what follows. It is a short form of “what is worse.”
It requires a comma before it to cut it off from “or,”
and a comma after it to cut it off from what follows.
When cut off, the sense relation between “whim” and
“economy” is made unmistakable. But sentences
of this type are, as stated above, almost invariably
punctuated wrong; and the sense relations are thus
obscured. The wrong punctuation is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>18-1. It is a matter of whim, or worse, of economy.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the next illustrative sentence (No. 18A) the new
word is simply one that more nearly expresses the
writer’s meaning. The comma before “or” is clearly
required; but why put a comma after “easier”?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>18A. It belongs in the lower, or, as it would be better
to call it, the easier, grades of work.</p></blockquote>

<p>The comma after “easier” acts with the comma
before “or” to suspend what comes between “lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>”
and “grades,” just as a similar group of words is
suspended in Sentence 3-1.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">OR</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">AND</span></p>

<p>The relations expressed by “or” and “and” are
so nearly identical that every rule or principle of
punctuation requiring a mark before one of them
requires it before the other in similarly formed sentences.
Only an occasional use of “and” expresses
a shade of meaning like that expressed by “or” in
the above sentences. For this reason it may be well
to caution the student against the common error of
using a comma before “and” in a sentence formed
like No. 18A, but not like it in meaning:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>18A-1. We are not willing to give our sanction to the
broad and, when applied in a case like that at bar, harsh
rule of instruction.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">APPOSITIVES</span></p>

<p>A class of words called “appositives” falls under
the classification and reasoning we have been considering;
and an example or two will suffice to show this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>19. The word, eagle, is derived from the Latin.</p>

<p>19-1. The word <i>eagle</i> is derived from the Latin.</p></blockquote>

<p>In No. 19 “eagle” is used to explain what word,
and might very properly go into the class of words
that we have called purely parenthetical. It seems
to be more closely allied to the class of appositives,
and thus takes a grammatical relation which makes
it slightly parenthetical, or explanatory.</p>

<p>In No. 19 “word” is the subject of the sentence;
“eagle” shows with what “word” we are dealing.
In No. 19-1 “word” is adjectival in meaning, and can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
no more take a comma than can “good” in “good
man.” “Eagle,” as a word, is the subject of the
sentence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>19-2. His son John did all the work on the farm.</p>

<p>19-3. His son, John, did all the work on the farm.</p></blockquote>

<p>In No. 19-2 we are told that <i>one</i> of his sons,
named “John,” did the work. In No. 19-3 we are
told that his son, not his daughter nor <i>one</i> of his sons,
did the work. “John” is simply explanatory, as is
“who is at home” in No. 14-3.</p>

<p>In Nos. 19 and 19-3 we have language that expresses
a different meaning from that expressed in
Nos. 19-1 and 19-2; and therefore we use the commas
to show that the <i>apparent</i> meaning of the two
former sentences is not the <i>real</i> meaning of the two
latter.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">VOCATIVES</span></p>

<p>Likewise the so-called vocatives, or words of
address, come, though somewhat indirectly, under
this same classification and reasoning:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>19B. Ring out, wild bells.</p></blockquote>

<p>If expressed in full, the sentence would read as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>19B-1. Ring ye, wild bells, out.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here “wild bells” is merely an appositive of the
subject, “ye,” which is understood in No. 19B.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">EXAMPLES</span></p>

<p class="small">Why do we use commas in No. 25-1, and not in No. 25?
In No. 25, “confidently” and “frequently” are coördinate in
sense, and are bound together to complete a thought. In No.
25-1 “confidently” and “mistakenly” are not coördinate in
sense, and express quite different thoughts. “Mistakenly” is
an afterthought, a slightly parenthetical word, and here stands
in an <i>apparent</i> relation to another word, which relation the
comma shows is not its real relation.</p>

This group of words is added as an afterthought, and to give a

<p class="small">No. 28 says the meal was a <i>royal</i> one. The word <i>supped</i> is

meal. No. 28-1 defines the meal as worthy to be called a <i>dinner</i>,
the principle meal of the day, or a <i>royal</i> supper, that is, a meal
far above what one expects in a mere <i>supper</i>.</p>

GROUPING DONE BY THE SEMICOLON AND
THE COLON</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> far in our discussion we have considered
grouping done by commas only, except incidentally
in Sentences 6, 6-2, 7, 7-1, and 7-2. We shall
now consider the application of our fundamental
principle to grouping that requires the semicolon and
the colon.</p>

<p>Our first illustrative sentence (No. 20) is from a
distinguished writer, noted for the “infinite care he
gives to his diction.” We think the sentence decidedly
distracting:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>20. I have an arrangement to do a serial for Harper’s,
and a series of wayside pieces for Scribner’s, Smith illustrating,
is on the tapis.</p></blockquote>

<p>Probably very few persons, in reading the above
sentence at sight, would take notice from the first
comma that the sentence is here divided into two
shorter sentences (the grammarians call these sentence-parts
<i>clauses</i>). In the absence of such notice,
the reader goes on to “is” before discovering the real
relation of the group of words following “and.” The
comma before “and” does not clearly show that
“and” connects the two larger groups of the sentence,
and so gives notice to the reader that the first group,
which is one of the clauses, is complete; nor, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
absence of such notice, is the reader told that the
words immediately following “and” look forward,
instead of backward, for their completion as a group.</p>

<p>The confusion or uncertainty of grouping is here
further increased by the character of the two groups
between which “and” appears to stand. Each begins
with the same word (a), thus making them appear
to be coördinate groups; and each group appears
to be the object of “do.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the author would contend that the comma
before “and” is sufficient to give notice of the proper
grouping, just as we used a comma for a somewhat
similar grouping in Sentence 1-1. Such contention
would not be without merit; but Sentence 1-1 is
much shorter, and the consequent liability to make
the wrong grouping is much less. Our discussion
might thus end in a difference of opinion without
determining the degree of separation requiring a
mark of higher rank than the comma. The discussion
could be opened by an admission on our part
that a semicolon in No. 1-1 would be better than the
comma; for its warning of the change of grouping
would be unmistakable by any reader.</p>

<p>Two reasons may be given for the use of the comma
in No. 1-1, instead of the semicolon; and we give
them in order to emphasize the fact that we cannot
always have in language one degree of separation
that calls unmistakably for the comma, and another
degree that calls unmistakably for the semicolon.
The reasons for the use of the comma in No. 1-1 are
as follows:</p>

<p>1. As the sentence is very short, the eye readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
catches the relation requiring the grouping that carries
“their mothers” forward for its connection, instead of
backward to “children.”</p>

<p>2. The use of a semicolon in this sentence might
seem to justify a rule requiring a semicolon in every
sentence composed of two clauses, while convention
hardly justifies such punctuation. On the other
hand, if we prefer the use of the semicolon in No. 1-1,
under what conditions would the comma be preferred?
If what immediately follows the conjunction
between any two clauses, especially short ones, does
not suggest connection with what precedes, a comma
before the conjunction gives sufficient notice of the
grouping of the language into two clauses.</p>

<p>Thus we have forced upon us, at least apparently,
the necessity of making choice in many sentences
between the comma and the semicolon. The problem
is further complicated by the need of the different
classes of readers for whom the marks in language are
used, and still further by convention.</p>

<p>The proper punctuation of No. 20 is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>20-1. I have an arrangement to do a serial for
Harper’s; and a series of wayside pieces for Scribner’s,
Smith illustrating, is on the tapis.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our next sentence is particularly interesting because
of its character and its source. It is from a
book by a distinguished literary man, who is the
professor of English in one of our leading universities
and the author of a text-book on English composition.
The book from which the sentence is taken was
printed at The Riverside Press, which has long been
considered by many to be the best printing-office in
the world:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>21. The deliberate good sense with which Franklin
treated matters of religion and morality, he displayed
equally in his scientific writings; and, a little later, in his
public documents and correspondence,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> which made him
as eminent in diplomacy and statecraft as he had earlier
been in science and in local affairs.</p></blockquote>

<p>In No. 20-1 we use a semicolon expressly to show
that what immediately follows the mark looks forward
for its connection; and, it seems to us, the semicolon
in No. 21 cannot fail to give to any reader, with
or without much knowledge of marks, notice that a
complete new group, and not an additional part of the
preceding group, is to follow the semicolon. If the
reader is looking forward for a new group (a clause),
the ending of the sentence gives him a surprise, and
compels him to read over the entire sentence to make
the proper grouping.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say just what notice a comma
before “and” in Sentence 21 would give most readers.
Let us so punctuate it, and challenge the comma.
What will its answer be? This, of course, is a
question that the reader puts to himself, testing his
own knowledge of the marks. In the light of our
discussion of Sentence 1, the comma might seem to say
that “and” does not connect “writings” with some
noun to follow. We shall see, later in our discussion,
that a comma may be necessary in a grouping almost
like this; but in this sentence the reader has another
aid, in fact two others, thus making the comma unnecessary,
if not objectionable. The word “equally,”
which comes before “in his scientific writings,” raises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>the expectation of a similar group to follow and to be
introduced by a suitable connecting word. As “and”
is such a word, the absence of a mark of punctuation
before it at once suggests that a like group is to follow.
The second aid to the reader in the process of grouping
is the word “in,” which introduces each of the groups
connected by “and,” and identifies the second group
as the coördinate of the first.</p>

<p class="tb">We punctuate to aid the reader quickly to grasp
<i>through the eye</i> the groupings of printed language, and
to enable him to determine the relations between the
groups thus formed. When a mark is not needed for
this purpose, it may be omitted.</p>

<p class="tb">If we say <i>the man is in a bad state of mind and in
an equally bad state of body</i>, the eye catches the words
“and” and “in,” at the end of the line, practically at
the same instant. The “in” tells of the grouping so
distinctly that a comma is not needed to inform the
reader that no word follows “and” to be connected by
it to “mind.” Therefore we say, when groups are so
similarly formed that the word following the conjunction
gives ample notice of the grouping, a comma
is not needed. We shall consider this point
more fully in another place.</p>

<p>By a slight change in the wording of No. 21, we
get a counterpart of the illustrative grouping just
given:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>21-1. He displayed good judgment in his scientific
writings and in his public documents.</p></blockquote>

<p>The grouping here is so unmistakable as to make
a comma before “and” quite objectionable. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
unmistakable because of the like formation of the
groups, and also because of the absence of any word
after “and” that suggests a wrong relation to what
precedes.</p>

<p>Now, if we do introduce a word or two between
“and” and “in,” and such words do not suggest relation
to what precedes, we may still omit the comma
before “and.” This reasoning, with that above,
suggests the best punctuation of No. 21, which is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>21-2. The deliberate good sense with which Franklin
treated matters of religion and morality, he displayed
equally in his scientific writings and, a little later, in his
public documents and correspondence, which made him
as eminent in diplomacy and statecraft as he had earlier
been in science and local affairs.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus we find no need of any mark before “and”
in this sentence, where a painstaking writer uses a
semicolon.</p>

<p>As “and,” even in No. 21-1, does not connect
“writings” with “documents,” but connects the two
groups of words beginning with “in,” the adjective
clause in No. 21-2 beginning with “which” can
hardly go over into the first group, and there find a
noun which it may seem to modify.</p>

<p class="tb">To illustrate how puzzling a rule may be, and
how wrong, we quote the following rule from Mr.
Wilson’s work (page 113):</p>

<p><i>When a sentence consists of three or more clauses,
united by a conjunction, none of which are susceptible
of division, a semicolon should be put between those</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
<i>which are least connected in sense, and a comma only
between the others.</i></p>

<p>To illustrate this rule, the following sentence is
given in Mr. Wilson’s book (the italics are ours):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>22. The woods may disappear, <i>but</i> the spirit of them
never will now; <i>for</i> it has been felt by a poet, <i>and</i> we can
feel for ever<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> what he felt.</p></blockquote>

<p>Does the punctuation indicate the real sense relations
in this sentence? We think not. The semicolon
before “for” divides the sentence into two
parts; but what follows the semicolon is clearly not
in the <i>for</i> relation with all that precedes it, as it
should be if the sentence is divided into two parts at
this point. The sense relation expressed by “for”
is unmistakably between all that follows it and what
precedes it back to “but.”</p>

<p>The real division of the sentence into two parts is
made at “but,” as shown in the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>22-1. The woods may disappear, but the spirit of
them never will now.</p></blockquote>

<p>Expanding the above, to emphasize the relations,
but still maintaining the sense of No. 22, we get the
following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>22-2. The woods may disappear, for they are material
and will decay; but the spirit of them never will now,
for it has been felt by a poet and we can feel forever what
he felt.</p></blockquote>

<p>In No. 22-2 we added a commonplace modifier
to the first statement in the sentence, in order to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>exhibit more clearly the similar relation between two
like groups in the second part of the sentence, which
take a semicolon in the quoted sentence (No. 22).</p>

<p>Punctuated so as to show the real sense relations,
the sentence reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>22-3. The woods may disappear: but the spirit of
them never will now; for it has been felt by a poet, and we
can feel forever what he felt.</p></blockquote>

<p>A thorough comprehension of the groupings in
these sentences, which is based upon sense relations,
will illuminate the punctuation already discussed.
It will also explain some apparent, if not real, inconsistencies
that are inevitable in dealing with marks
to express indefinite degrees of relation.</p>

<p>Sentence 1 is composed of two clauses connected
by a conjunction, as is also Sentence 22-1. The
liability to error in grouping Sentence 1 may be sufficient
to require a semicolon; but the grouping in
Sentence 22-1 is so unmistakable that a comma is
sufficient to give notice of a change in the direction of
the thought. In Sentence 21 the semicolon gives notice
of a grouping which does not follow. In Sentence 22
the grouping by punctuation does not follow the
meaning of the language, and is therefore wrong.</p>

<p>Wrong grouping is perhaps most common in
sentences containing groups requiring coördinate conjunctions,
such as “and” and “but.” Quite often
such sentences cannot be so punctuated as to show
the correct grouping by the marks. The following
sentence is an example:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>23. The Society has expelled two of its members for
unprofessional conduct, and has investigated complaints
<span class="pagenum" style="font-weight: normal;"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>against two other members, but it has been unable to
obtain enough evidence to convict them.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is not bad punctuation, for it conveys the
meaning, which, however, is not difficult to obtain;
but it is not good punctuation, for the marks do not
group the words in accordance with the sense relations
that exist between the groups.</p>

<p>If the sentence were divided into two parts by
“but,” the <i>but</i> relation would exist between what
follows and <i>each</i> of the groups of words coördinated
by the conjunction “and.” Thus we would say, “The
Society has expelled four of its members for unprofessional
conduct, but <i>has been unable to obtain enough
evidence to convict them</i>.” As this relation does not
make sense, we know that the “but” relation exists
between what follows it and what precedes it back
to “and.” As the <i>but</i> relation does not extend beyond
“and,” this fact should be shown by the mark, thus
requiring a larger mark (semicolon) before “and.”
But a semicolon before “and” would separate two
closely connected groups (predicates),—“has expelled”
and “has investigated.” It would also connect the
second group with the third, making one larger group
in the <i>and</i> relation with the first.</p>

<p>As the sense relations here require a grouping
inconsistent with the grammatical relations, a change
in the language becomes necessary before it can be
properly punctuated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>23-1. The Society has expelled two of its members
for unprofessional conduct; and <i>it</i> has investigated complaints
against two other members, but has been unable
to obtain enough evidence to convict them.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p>The insertion of “it” (a new subject) after “and,”
and its omission after “but,” with the proper use of
the semicolon, make clear the two things done by
the Society, and make this clear by the proper
grouping of words to show the unmistakable thought-grouping.</p>

<p>If we are required to punctuate language which
we are not permitted to change, our punctuation may
have to depart from our system, whether established
by rule or by reason. A study of such punctuation
will lead to a nice discrimination in both marks
and relations. Our next sentence, with its different
modes of punctuation, will illustrate the point. The
sentence is given in three forms: (1) as it appeared in
a literary journal; (2) as it is printed in the Common
Version of the New Testament (2 Timothy i, 16);
and (3) as it is printed in the Revised Version. We
shall, however, not follow its division into two verses,
as it appears in the Common Version of the Bible:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>24. The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus;
for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my
chain; but, when he was in Rome, he sought me out
diligently, and found me.</p>

<p>24-1. The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus;
for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed
of my chain: but, when he was in Rome, he sought me out
very diligently, and found me.</p>

<p>24-2. The Lord grant mercy unto the house of
Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not
ashamed of my chain; but, when he was in Rome, he
sought me out diligently, and found me.</p></blockquote>

<p>In each of these three sentences the punctuation
divides the language into three larger groups of words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
two of which are subdivided by commas. In the
second and third a colon indicates a second grouping
of each sentence into two main parts, but not at the
same point. If the semicolons and the colons were
challenged for their meanings, the answers would
show an interesting variety of grouping of words, as
well as a variety of sense relations. Such a variety
of punctuation is common only because the actual
significance of marks, in their grouping and relational
effects, has not been considered.</p>

<p>These sentences present the same problem, though
somewhat further complicated, that was presented
by Nos. 22 and 23. We have only to ask ourselves
how far the <i>but</i>, <i>for</i>, and <i>and</i> relations extend. Do the
marks so group the words as to indicate the sense
relations by the grouping? Of course they do not,
as is shown by the difference in the groupings. In No.
24 neither semicolon shows how far the <i>for</i> or the
<i>but</i> relation extends; and therefore neither mark is
an efficient sign-board. If challenged for a meaning,
neither could give the reader an intelligent answer.</p>

<p>In each of Nos. 24-1 and 24-2 the colon makes
another grouping, dividing each sentence into two still
larger groups. Here each mark would give a definite
answer to a challenge; but both answers could not be
correct. The sentence is unmistakably divided into
two parts, the first part ending with “Onesiphorus.”
Mercy is sought for him because of what he did; and
what he did is specified in the language that follows
“for.” The extent of the <i>for</i> relation, therefore, must
be shown by the mark. A colon will clearly show that
it goes to the end of the sentence, as a like relation
was shown by the colon in No. 6-2.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>We now have to deal with the proper grouping of
all that follows “for”; but we cannot use a colon for
this purpose because, having been used once, a second
colon in the same sentence would confuse the whole
grouping. We thus come to a serious difficulty,
which arises out of the number of groups to be made
with the marks (comma and semicolon) left at our
disposal. This difficulty would be even greater in
No. 24-2 had we quoted the sentence in full, the
complete verse containing another clause. In the
second of the two larger groups we have an <i>and</i> and a
<i>but</i> relation exactly like the <i>and</i> and <i>but</i> relations in
No. 23, which we could not indicate by marks. As
we may not change the language of the sentence
under consideration, we must punctuate it with as
little violence to the meanings of marks as possible.
Probably the clearest punctuation of the sentence
would be as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>24-3. The Lord grant mercy unto the house of
Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed
of my chain, but, when he was in Rome, he sought me
very diligently, and found me.</p></blockquote>

<p>As the sentence is thus divided into two main
parts, with only commas in one part, the semicolon
is sufficient to mark the larger groups. As the comma
before “but” does not suggest to the reader how far
back the <i>but</i> relation extends, he is left to ascertain
it without the aid of a mark definitely pointing it out.</p>

<p>We do not claim this to be good punctuation, but
we think it the best the sentence will permit. The
sentence seems to show the fault of bad grouping.</p>

<p>If we are ever in doubt as to how far back a rela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>tion,
indicated or to be indicated by a mark before
the conjunction, extends, we can easily determine
this by forming the relation between the words <i>apparently</i>
thus connected. Take, for instance, Sentence
24. The <i>for</i> relation between “give mercy” and
“was not ashamed” is just as evident as the <i>for</i> relation
between “give mercy” and “he oft refreshed me.”
We can say “give mercy, for he oft refreshed me” and
“give mercy, for he was not ashamed.”</p>

<p>Let us attempt to make a like grouping to determine
how far back the <i>but</i> relation extends. It appears
to extend to the two preceding groups, which,
being connected by “and” and put between two semicolons,
constitute one group. This would give us
“was not ashamed, but sought me” and<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> “refreshed
me, but sought me.” The sense, of course, shows
that the second group is not a proper group.</p>

<p>A writer, as we shall see later, should always
guard against using a conjunction between words or
groups of words not bearing to each other the relation
indicated by such conjunction. Much confusion in
punctuation arises from an effort to indicate by the
use of marks relations that are not sense relations,
as in the sentences just considered.</p>

<p class="tb">A somewhat different, but even more effective,
grouping is shown by another use of the colon; but,
very singularly, practically all writers on punctuation
seem to ignore this use. Before considering it, we
shall take up the colon’s conventional use, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
that of the “formal” introduction of any matter,
such as particulars, a speech, or a quotation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>25. I purchased the following articles: one dozen
pens, one ream of paper, and one box of envelopes.</p>

<p>25-1. The speaker arose, and addressed the audience
as follows:</p>

<p>“The occasion which brings us together,” etc.</p>

<p>25-2. The speaker said: “The occasion which brings
us together,” etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is difficult to find a reason for this use of the
colon, inasmuch as what follows the colon in any of
the above sentences, is not a “limb” of the sentence.
The relation in No. 25 is clearly that of apposition;
and it is the same in Nos. 25-1 and 25-2. In the
latter the apposition is between some word not
expressed, but understood, and what follows,—for
example, “addressed the audience <i>in language</i> such
as follows,” “the speaker said <i>these things</i>.”</p>

<p class="tb">We have called this the “conventional” use because
it has become the accepted punctuation. We
introduce it here in order to show that this same relation
(apposition) governs in a frequent use of this mark
which is not explained by the writers on punctuation.</p>

<p>Before passing to this use of the colon, let us make
sure that the meaning of “formal introduction” is
quite clear to us. It means that the matter following
the colon is announced or suggested in a manner somewhat
similar to the announcement made in the words
<i>viz.</i>, <i>as follows</i>, etc. It thus implies that the matter
is introduced according to a <i>form</i>. “He said,” followed
by a colon, is one of the usual conventional
forms; but <i>he said that</i> is not so considered, and no
mark at all follows “said.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>We use a colon throughout this work at the end
of the line preceding an example if the example illustrates
what precedes. This use of the colon ties the
example to what <i>precedes</i>. See the colon preceding
Sentence 25, above.</p>

<p>It is also to be noted that the colon loses, in this
formal and conventional use, its <i>relative</i> value, that is,
its rank above the comma and the semicolon. Thus
it often appears in only one or in both of the semicolon-divided
groups of a sentence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>25-3. In a bill of exchange there are three original
parties: drawer, drawee, and payee; in a promissory note,
only two parties: the maker and the payee.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here we see that the colons are used to group
each one of the two parts into which the sentence
is divided by a <i>semicolon</i>. We shall show later
(Sentence 33) what we consider a much better mode
of punctuating such sentences, and thus avoiding the
appearance of making the colon subordinate to the
semicolon.</p>

<p>We are here seeking to exhibit the relation of
apposition. When words or groups of words stand
in this relation, the second word or group expresses
in another form what is expressed in the first word or
group of words. In No. 25 what follows the colon
is the same as “articles,” which precedes it. If the
word “articles” were omitted, the colon would still
be used, “articles” or a like word being understood,
as some word is understood in Nos. 25-1 and 25-2.
The same relation is shown in Sentence 32-2 by means
of parentheses.</p>

<p>With this understanding of the relation between
groups separated by the colon, our next illustrative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
sentence is particularly interesting, not only because
of its character, but because of its source. As
punctuated, it fails to show a nice meaning in language
which is quite easily overlooked in the absence of the
proper distinguishing mark; and it is from a letter
by Thomas Bailey Aldrich in reply to one, from a
friend, which he could not decipher. It appears in
the foremost printers’ magazine in the country, a
magazine that often discusses the subject of punctuation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>26. There is a singular and a perpetual charm in a
letter of yours; it never grows old; it never loses its novelty.</p></blockquote>

<p>The use of two semicolons, dividing this sentence
into three clauses, signifies that these clauses are in
like relation to each other,—that is, that they are
coördinate in sense. If the <i>and</i> or the <i>or</i> relation exists
between the first and second clauses, it must exist
between the second and third, just as it exists between
the three items named in the second part of No. 25.</p>

<p>A very slight examination of the meaning of the
language of this sentence shows that the clauses are
not coördinate in sense, although such coördination
is indicated by the use of the same mark between
them.</p>

<p>The relation between the second and third clauses
is exhibited in the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>26-1. It never grows old; and it never loses its
novelty.</p></blockquote>

<p>We cannot unite the first and second clauses
in this way, and retain the real meaning of the language;
nor have we, thus far in our study, found a
meaning of the semicolon that would give the reader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
notice of the relation between the first clause of No.
26 and what follows. The second and third clauses
of this sentence are as plainly explanatory of the first
clause as are the items that follow the colon in No. 25
explanatory of “articles.” A change in the wording
of the sentence will show that it is exactly similar in
its relation to No. 25:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>26-2. Your letter possesses the following singular
and perpetual charms: youthfulness and novelty.</p></blockquote>

<p>If this relation exists between the principal
thought and the detailed items, then we may indicate
it by the colon, thus dividing the sentence into two
groups with the relation of apposition between them:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>26-3. There is a singular and a perpetual charm in
a letter of yours: it never grows old; it never loses its
novelty.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us note how carefully language is used in this
sentence: the letter possesses a <i>singular</i> charm (it
never loses its novelty) and a <i>perpetual</i> charm (it
never grows old).</p>

<p>The colon both groups the language and shows the
relation (apposition) between the two main groups.
On the other hand, the semicolon in this sentence
stands where the sense relation is the <i>and</i> relation.</p>

<p>It is not quite proper to say that the second and
third clauses are explanatory simply of “charm”:
they are explanatory of the entire first clause, repeating
and expanding the thought expressed in that
clause, just as what follows the colon in the sentence
we are writing explains what precedes.</p>

<p class="tb">Our next illustrative sentence is from one of
Howell’s novels, which was printed at The Riverside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Press. It has the fault of No. 26, and the added
fault of an indefinite <i>but</i> relation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>27. He was not candid; he did not shun concealments
and evasions; but positive lies he had kept from.</p></blockquote>

<p>The second clause is clearly explanatory of the
first; and the third clause simply modifies the second
by showing the degree of untruthfulness of the man.</p>

<p>With the new meaning of the colon we are now
considering, a colon after “candid” informs the reader
of the relation between the main groups of the sentence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>27-1. He was not candid: he did not shun concealments
and evasions; but positive lies he had kept from.</p></blockquote>

<p>So far as the mere grouping is concerned, this
could be done in Nos. 26 and 27 by a semicolon and
a comma in each; but the semicolon would not inform
the reader of the true relation between the two larger
groups. The colon would still be required if the next
two groups took a comma, or even no mark, between
them.</p>

<p>We called this relation that of apposition. We
might say, somewhat more specifically, that the second
group is an amplification in language to express an
extension of the idea, or to fortify the image, of the
first group. This purpose may also be accomplished
by a contrast between the ideas expressed in the two
groups.</p>

<p>The writer on punctuation who says, as do many
such writers, that the colon is an obsolete mark,
except in its formal use for enumeration, does so, we
believe, in ignorance of the useful and beautiful purpose
it performs in a very large class of sentences.</p>

<p class="small">The above is the punctuation of the Common Version of
Isaiah xi, 7. The American Revised Version uses a semicolon
instead of the colon, thus making a series of the three groups of
words. We think the latter poor punctuation, because the first
and second groups form one picture, and the third group forms
another. The two pictures are revealed by the use of the semicolon
and the colon; and intelligently to read the verse aloud
requires a shorter pause at the semicolon than at the colon. The
two pictures are clearly indicated by “feeding” in one group,
and “eating” in the other.</p>

or a guise of greed; a cheerful old custom, or a futile
old farce, according to the spirit and the form which
it takes.</p>

<p class="small">This sentence, from a well-known writer, is poorly punctuated,
and has another fault, which will be revealed by an effort
to punctuate the group of words following “farce” so as to
show to what it belongs.</p>

<p class="small">The omission of a comma before the first “or” is proper;
the use of one before each following “or” is unnecessary.</p>

<p class="small">“A fine thing” and “a foolish thing” are general terms,
and are followed by four illustrations in alternative groups,—for
instance, “an encouragement to friendliness” is “a fine
thing,” and “a tribute to fashion” is “a foolish thing.” This
sense relation requires a colon after “be.”</p>

<p class="small">“According to the spirit and the form which it takes” belongs
to each semicolon group following the colon; and, moreover,
it is a mere duplication in sense of “as the case may be.”
It is difficult, by punctuation, unmistakably to separate this
group from exclusive modification of the group it follows, and
thus tie it to the four groups, where it seems to belong.</p>

<p class="small">The substitution of “according to the spirit and the form
it takes” for “as the case may be,” would convey, it seems to us,
the author’s full meaning. With the omission of commas as
suggested, this would give the following:</p>

<p>22-1. The custom of exchanging presents on a
certain day in the year is a fine thing or a foolish
thing, according to the spirit and the form which it
takes: an encouragement to friendliness or a tribute
to fashion; an expression of good nature or a bid for
favor; an outgoing of generosity or a guise of greed;
a cheerful old custom or a futile old farce.</p>

<p>23. The philosophical elements of his work are
not especially profound or novel; its descriptive merits
are considerable; but its deficiencies as an orderly and

<p class="small">The sense relations between the three clauses of the above
sentence are not properly expressed by its conjunctions, “and”
(understood) and “but.” The incongruity of the <i>and</i> relation
becomes apparent upon reading the first and second clauses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>with “and” between them. The use of two semicolons in the
sentence renders the “but” relation indeterminate.</p>

<p class="small">The sentence needs to be recast, which may be done as
follows:</p>

<p>23-1. The philosophical elements of his work are
not especially profound or novel; and, although its
descriptive merits are considerable, its deficiencies as
an orderly and inclusive narrative are, to say the
least, perplexing.</p>

<p>24. Amateurs in literary composition soon acquire
the bad habit of writing carelessly; they spell strange
names in two or more different ways; they form
capital letters, and even the small lower-case letters,
so obscurely that one word may be mistaken for
another; they have no clearly defined system, or at
least observe none, for the proper placing of capitals,
italic, and the marks of punctuation.</p>

<p class="small">The above sentence is from the preface of what is probably
the most complete work on composition written in recent years.
A preceding sentence contains the statement that our high
schools do not “thoroughly teach the correct expression of
thought in writing.”</p>

<p class="small">In view of this charge against our high schools, and because
the sentence under consideration is itself a type of careless
construction, very common among even good writers, the
sentence becomes interesting. It is divided by semicolons into
four clauses, apparently in a series; but an analysis of the meaning
of the language will show that the four clauses do not constitute
a series.</p>

<p class="small">Four charges against amateurs are made in the sentence,
in brief, as follows:</p>

<p class="small">1. Writing carelessly.</p>

<p class="small">2. Spelling names differently.</p>

<p class="small">3. Forming letters obscurely.</p>

<p class="small">4. Possessing, or observing, no system in the use of capitals,
italics, and marks of punctuation.</p>

<p><small>If these four faults form a series, what does “writing carelessly”
mean? To spell a word in different ways, to form letters
obscurely, or to observe no system in the use of capitals, etc., is
“writing carelessly.” In short, the first term of the four is a</small>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
<small>general statement, of which the three terms that follow are details.
This fact should be shown by the punctuation.</small></p>

SOME USES OF THE DASH</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is often said that the dash is the mark of ignorance
in punctuation. When a writer does not know
how to punctuate his own language at any point
he uses a dash. When one, in the preparation of
another’s manuscript for the printer, cannot exactly
make out the meaning at any point, and therefore
does not know what mark to use, he inserts a dash.
When the printer, who does most of the world’s
punctuation, is in doubt, he uses a dash.</p>

<p>Out of this mass of hit-or-miss punctuation,
many writers of text-books on punctuation have
attempted to formulate rules for the use of the dash.
The result is—“all that could be expected.”</p>

<p>The dash is a useful mark. It came late into our
language; and it came to meet a real need, which
our illustrative sentences and discussions, we hope,
will reveal.</p>

<p>One of the distinctive uses of the dash is to indicate
a rhetorical pause made by a speaker for a
specific and well-understood purpose. Mr. De Vinne
says “the dash should be selected whenever
there is an abrupt change in a statement.” This is
the primary use of the mark, and is the one generally
understood by persons with even a slight knowledge
of punctuation. Mr. De Vinne illustrates his definition
by a sentence which possesses special interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
for the student of punctuation. This sentence appears
also in the works of Mr. Wilson and Mr. Bigelow,
and in several other text-books on punctuation. As
Mr. Wilson’s work antedates all the others, it is probable
that he first used the sentence.</p>

<p>As Mr. Bigelow and Mr. De Vinne made changes,
even though slight, in the sentence, its study becomes
both interesting and informing. We give the sentence
as written by each of these writers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>28. <span class="smcap">Here lies the great</span>—False marble! where?<br />
Nothing but sordid dust lies here.—Wilson.</p>

<p>28-1. Here lies the great— False marble! where?<br />
Nothing but sordid dust lies here.—Bigelow.</p>

<p>28-2. Here lies the great—false marble! where?<br />
<span class="h">28-2. Her</span>Nothing but sordid dust lies here.—De Vinne.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us carefully compare these examples, and
ask the meanings of the different modes of printing
them.</p>

<p>In No. 28 the first four words are in small-capital
letters, the first word of the sentence beginning, of
course, with a capital. The word “false” begins with
a capital.</p>

<p>In No. 28-1 there are no small-capital letters,
and there is a space after the dash.</p>

<p>In 28-2 “false” begins with a small letter.</p>

<p>We are not particularly concerned with the
second part of the example (nothing but sordid dust
lies here).</p>

<p>What is the meaning of the small-capital letters
in No. 28?</p>

<p>What is the meaning of the space following the
dash in No. 28-1?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>What is the meaning of the capital letter beginning
“false” in Nos. 28 and 28-1, and of the
small letter beginning the same word in No. 28-2?</p>

<p>What punctuation will best reveal the full meaning
of this sentence, so differently treated by these
well-known writers?</p>

<p>We venture to assert that few readers would
grasp at the first reading the <i>real</i> relations in this
sentence, and, further, that not a few cultured readers
would make bad work of the sense in reading No.
28-2 at sight.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson makes no explanation of his use of the
small-capital letters; and their absence from Nos.
28-1 and 28-2 imply that Mr. Bigelow and Mr.
De Vinne attached no importance to them. We
think they serve a useful, if not an indispensable,
purpose; and it requires little imagination to picture
the scene which this typographical device suggests.
Let us imagine it, and learn one important use of the
dash.</p>

<p>On an anniversary day, a crowd stands before the
monument of a great man. Let us assume it to be a
monument of Shakespeare. The speaker is in the
midst of his oration, his listeners “hanging” on his
words. He turns to the statue, and, with pointing
finger, directs the attention of his hearers to the
inscription on the base of the monument, which
inscription reads as follows:</p>

<p class="center" style="page-break-before: always;">HERE LIES THE GREAT SHAKESPEARE</p>

<p>The orator begins slowly to read the inscription.
When he reaches the name of the great man, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
hesitates, turns his attention from the inscription to
the monument as a whole, and, without uttering the
name “Shakespeare,” passionately addresses the monument
thus:</p>

<p>“False marble! Where lies the great Shakespeare?
Nothing but sordid dust lies here.”</p>

<p>Having heard the speech, we come to prepare it
for the printed page. How shall we punctuate the
part of it now under consideration so as to convey the
meaning expressed by the speaker in the break made
after the word “great”? Mr. De Vinne’s mode (No.
28-2) of printing the language fails to show the grammatical
end of the first group of words (the inscription);
and, in the absence of such knowledge, the reader
will not readily catch the relation of “great” to “false
marble.” Mr. Wilson (No. 28) shows the change in
two ways: by a change in the style of letters in the first
word after the dash, and by beginning this word with
a capital letter. The sense of the language clearly
shows that the first group of words would have ended,
in the absence of the dash, where the dash ends. The
change from the style of letters (small capitals) also
shows this. As the practice of using no period after
a dash in sentences like No. 28 is thoroughly established,
the reader learns from the first letter of the next
word whether such word begins a new sentence. As
printed in Mr. De Vinne’s work, “false,” beginning
with a small letter, appears to be a part of what precedes,
giving the meaning of “the great, false marble.”
As printed in Mr. Wilson’s work, “False” begins a
new sentence, and should have the usual space before
it; but is it correct?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Bigelow, apparently seeing the difficulty we
are discussing, puts a space after the dash, thus ending
the sentence with the dash. This of course
requires that “false” begin with a capital letter, the
word being the first word in a new sentence.</p>

<p>We believe that if “false” is written with a capital
letter, thus making a new sentence, the dash should
be followed by the space that is used to separate
sentences.</p>

<p>Our conclusions would require that the sentence
be written in the following way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>28-3. “Here lies the great”— False marble! where?</p></blockquote>

<p>Let it be remembered that we are attempting in
the above sentence to reproduce on the printed page
<i>what</i> a speaker said and <i>how</i> he said it.</p>

<p>If the first four words are a part of the inscription,
the fact must be shown; and it is shown in
No. 28-3 by the quotation-marks. The use of small
capitals in No. 28 is much more suggestive of an inscription
than the use of the quotation-marks in No.
28-3.</p>

<p>In our next illustrative sentence, the grammatical
connection within the sentence is perfect, but the
sense changes. Here the dash is used to suspend the
thought in preparation for the surprise to come. It
is a rhetorical mark, for it indicates how the words
would be spoken:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>29. He never lacked a good word—from those who
spoke his praise.</p></blockquote>

<p>A speaker or a writer often wishes to repeat a part
of or all that he has said, and then continue with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
his line of thought, using different words for emphasis,
for exactness, or for other reasons. Or he
may wish in this way to summarize what he has
already said, completing the sentence with the
summarizing word as the subject. There seems to
be no grammatical relation between the summarizing
group of words and what precedes them. The dash
serves to show the break in the sentence, and is thus
merely a rhetorical mark:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>30. He has been unkindly—he has been shamefully
treated.</p>

<p>31. Persecution, injustice, ruined fortune—all seemed
insignificant.</p></blockquote>

<p>The office of the dash in each of the above sentences
might be performed by a blank space of equal
length; but such space might not always be easily distinguished
from the usual spaces between words.</p>

<p>Some English writers use dots or two or more
periods where we use dashes in sentences like the
above.</p>

<p class="tb">Our next illustrative sentence, with its modifications,
shows a very useful and quite indispensable
office of the dash. The sentence exemplifies one of
the commonest errors made by good writers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>32. The expenditure of this vast sum is entrusted to
school officers, trustees, inspectors, and commissioners.</p>

<p>32-1. The expenditure of this vast sum is entrusted
to school officers: trustees, inspectors, and commissioners.</p>

<p>32-2. The expenditure of this vast sum is entrusted
to school officers (trustees, inspectors, and commissioners).</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>32-3. The expenditure of this vast sum is entrusted
to school officers,—trustees, inspectors, and commissioners.</p></blockquote>

<p>The punctuation of No. 32 is erroneous, for it
does not show the relation between “school officers”
and what follows.</p>

<p>That of No. 32-1 is not bad; but the words following
“school officers” are not formally introduced,
and therefore do not require a colon.</p>

<p>That of No. 32-2 is not wholly bad; but the words
introduced are not a pure parenthesis, and to use
the marks of parenthesis in this way would unduly
extend their office.</p>

<p>That of No. 32-3 is the best, because the true
relation (apposition) of the words is maintained, and
is shown by a mark (the comma) already seen to be
the proper mark for this relation. The failure of the
comma to show the relation of apposition in No. 32
is due to the fact that the words following “officers”
form an <i>apparent</i> series with “officers.” The comma
here needs re-enforcing by a special grouping mark,
which office the dash performs. The comma shows
the relation; the dash does the grouping.</p>

<p>We spoke above of extending the office and limiting
the value of a mark. We mean by this that the
more uses and, in consequence, the more meanings a
mark has, the more difficult it is for the reader to
interpret it when he meets it. For this reason the
comma and dash seem to be the best mode of punctuating
sentences like the above.</p>

<p>As we saw in Sentence 6, the colon is used to mark
the largest divisions of a sentence; and it is used, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
in Sentence 25, for the formal introduction of particulars.
The former use is determined by the colon’s
rank, which is above the semicolon and below the
period; the latter use is conventional, and is without
reference to its rank.</p>

<p>If two colons appear in a sentence, one because of
its rank and one in the enumeration of particulars,
there may be a seeming inconsistency in grouping.
The same is true when a colon is used within a group
made by a semicolon. For instance, in No. 25-3 we
used a colon in each of two groups, the groups themselves
being separated by a semicolon. We think
it much better to use within each group the comma
and dash than to use the colon, thus emphasizing
the grouping done by the semicolon, instead
of apparently subordinating the colon in each group
to the semicolon making the two groups. This
would give the following punctuation for No. 25-3:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>33. In a bill of exchange there are three original
parties,—drawer, drawee, and payee; in a promissory note,
only two,—maker and payee.</p></blockquote>

<p>We have thus used a comma and a dash to set
off particulars formally introduced, making the punctuation
of No. 33 inconsistent with that of No. 25,
and apparently inconsistent with No. 32-2. If this
resulted in misleading a reader, objection might be
raised; but, we feel confident, this exceptional mode
of punctuation is justified.</p>

<p class="tb">In our next illustrative sentence we get away from
details either formally or almost formally introduced;
yet the relation to be shown by the punctuation is
just the same and quite as evident:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>34. She had a face altogether of the sunny south,—a
pure skin, black hair, and blue eyes.</p></blockquote>

<p>Professor Wendell uses this punctuation a great
deal and, we think, very effectively. Other good
writers do not use it at all; but they seem to have no
satisfactory substitute for it. Professor Wendell frequently
uses it twice in one sentence, as it is used in
No. 33. The following sentence is from his “Literary
History of America” (page 2):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>35. These records [of things seen and felt by men]
are often set forth in terms which may be used only by
those of rarely special gift and training,—the terms of
architecture and sculpture, of painting and music; but
oftener and more freely they are phrased in the terms
which all men learn somehow to use,—the terms of
language.</p></blockquote>

<p>We may perhaps turn aside from our discussion
of the dash to consider a point in the above sentence
which illustrates our general principle of grouping,
especially as exhibited in Sentences 10 to 10-3.</p>

<p>Many punctuators would set off by commas the
group “oftener and more freely” in No. 35 on the
ground that it is “an intermediate parenthetical
group.” This would be thoughtless punctuation
based upon a rule of questionable meaning. The <i>but</i>
relation in this sentence is between two groups of
words restricted, respectively, in meaning by “often”
and “oftener”; and commas should not be permitted
to destroy a grouping that shows the contrast. Somewhat
shortened, the sentence would read thus, readily
exhibiting the point under consideration:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>35-1. These records are <i>often</i> set forth in terms of
architecture; but <i>oftener</i> they are phrased in terms of
language.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>The italicized words here emphasize the restriction
of the thoughts that are in the <i>but</i> relation in
this sentence. In No. 10-2 commas perform this
office by holding the proper words in the <i>but</i> relation.
We may not assert that commas in the second clause
of No. 35 would change the meaning to the extent
that it is changed by the absence of commas in No.
10-1; but the point of emphasis would be somewhat
changed by their use in No. 35.</p>

<p class="tb">The combination of a comma and a dash to express
apposition is most useful when the thing to be
explained by the appositive words is suggested, as in
No. 34, and not indicated, as in No. 33. We find a
good illustration of this point in Gray’s Elegy as
punctuated by the author; and we also find in this
illustration what, we believe, is a late development of
the dash. The poet Gray was one of the most painstaking
writers known in literature. There was a
comma in the first line of the manuscript of his Elegy
in a Country Churchyard when sent to the printer:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>35A. The curfew tolls, the knell of parting day.</p></blockquote>

<p>The comma here means just what the comma in
No. 34 means. What follows “tolls” is in apposition
with the thing which “the curfew tolls” suggests, as
what follows the comma and dash in No. 34 is in
apposition with a picture suggested by what precedes.
The suggestion in No. 35A is less apparent and more
subtle than in No. 34.</p>

<p>The printer who received the manuscript of the
Elegy did not see the picture, and so left out the
comma, thus making the intransitive verb “tolls” a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
transitive verb. The poet’s musical ear felt the
improvement made thus unconsciously by the printer;
and the change was accepted.</p>

<p>In order more clearly to show the meaning of the
manuscript line, we should punctuate it with the comma
and dash:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>35A-1. The curfew tolls,—the knell of parting day.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus the dash is an aid to the comma in grouping
the appositive words, especially when following a
thought only implied.</p>

<p>There is a very common use of the dash that is
commended by all writers on punctuation; but not
one of these writers has formulated a rule that differentiates
the dash so used from marks of parenthesis.</p>

<p>A writer frequently uses a group of words that are
<i>purely</i> parenthetical in nature; and yet he desires to
give them grammatical connection with the sentence.
Such connection clearly takes them out of
the class of groups of words requiring marks of parenthesis;
but, because of their purely parenthetical
nature, it does not put them into the class requiring
commas or semicolons alone. As the group retains
a twofold nature, such nature may well be shown by
two marks. If it be said this is not good reasoning,
we may well resort to a rule which, with the explanation
of the conditions above given, together with a
very general practice, will quite distinctly differentiate
the class of sentences to be thus punctuated. Such
a rule will have, at least, the merit of producing a
certain degree of uniformity in punctuation. The rule
may be about as follows:</p>

<p><small><span class="smcap">Rule.</span>—Matter that is purely parenthetical in nature, and</small>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span><small>yet is given grammatical connection, slight or otherwise, with
what precedes it, may be set off by a dash or dashes together
with the mark that would be required by the language with the
parenthetical matter omitted.</small></p>

<p>One or two sentences will illustrate the points
under discussion:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>36. He cannot understand—nor can any of his leisurely
countrymen—why tomorrow will not answer as
well as today.</p></blockquote>

<p>The matter here set off by dashes is a side-remark,
purely parenthetical in nature, but given grammatical
connection by the use of the conjunction “nor.” If
the matter were not purely parenthetical, it would, of
course, not take the dashes. A sentence similar in
form will illustrate this point:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>36-1. He cannot understand, nor does he want to
understand, why tomorrow will not answer as well as
today.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the next sentence the grammatical relation is
in the nature of apposition; and yet what follows
“heroines” is not purely an appositive, for all “female
characters” are not “heroines.” The added thought
goes beyond the office of parenthetical matter, and
becomes an integral part of the sentence, which cannot
be omitted without changing the sense:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>37. George Eliot’s heroines—her female characters,
from first to last—are drawn with the serene firmness of
omniscience.</p></blockquote>

<p>The group of words here set off by dashes expresses
too much to be either an appositive of “heroines” or
a parenthesis explaining the meaning of “heroines”;
in short, it is neither wholly one nor the other, and
cannot be properly punctuated as belonging to one
or the other class of words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>It may be well to note here the difference between
Sentences 36 and 37 and Sentence 32-3, the latter
being a type of sentences often improperly punctuated
when the sentence is continued beyond the appositive
group of words. We have just read such a sentence
in the morning newspaper:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>38. There is literature in our newspapers—a lively,
colloquial, vivid literature, reflective of the life we lead—and
we are grateful for his [Augustine Birrell’s] admonition
that in the making of it we have regard first for
truth and afterward for beauty, if we find it.</p></blockquote>

<p>The error in the punctuation of the above sentence
was probably due to the lack of a clear definition, in
the mind of the writer, of the meanings of the dash.
The relation of the matter between the dashes to
what precedes is clearly that of apposition; and the
dash alone is quite generally used to express it. We
prefer, however, the comma and dash, as was shown in
our discussion of No. 32.</p>

<p>This relation makes the appositive group of words
a part of what has gone before, thus ending the first
clause with the end of the appositive group of words.
This puts the <i>and</i> relation between the two <i>larger</i>
groups of the sentence, thus making the use of the
second dash erroneous, and requiring a new grouping.
A semicolon will best perform this office.</p>

<p>Punctuated in accordance with the above reasoning,
and with some commas added, the sentence will
read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>38-1. There is literature in our newspapers,—a lively,
colloquial, vivid literature, reflective of the life we lead;
and we are grateful for his [Augustine Birrell’s] admoni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>tion
that, in the making of it, we have regard first for
truth, and afterward for beauty, if we find it.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center" style="page-break-before: always;"><span class="smcap lowercase">THE DASH AS A PARAGRAPH-MARK</span></p>

<p>In order to save space, the dash is used, purely
conventionally, between paragraphs not put in paragraph

in the definitions of any dictionary. It is permissible
especially on postal and correspondence cards, or

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;"><small><b>CHAPTER VI</b></small><br /><br />

PUNCTUATION BY REASON AND
CONVENTION</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> shall discuss in this chapter some uses of marks
determined partly by reason and partly by convention.
In a subsequent chapter we shall take up the
purely conventional uses of marks.</p>

<p>Among the commonest uses of marks is that of a
comma before the conjunction <i>that</i> introducing a group
of words. Our next two examples illustrate two
classes of sentences in which “that” connects the
parts of each sentence somewhat differently, permitting
a difference in punctuation. As such modes of
punctuation are not well settled by practice, and cannot
be determined by reason, the use or omission of
the comma in the second sentence (No. 40) becomes a
matter of taste. We prefer the comma:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>39. The court holds that the evidence is material.</p>

<p>40. The truth is, that we very much exaggerate the
power of riches.</p></blockquote>

<p>If it be said that punctuation which is a matter of
taste necessarily becomes inconsistent punctuation,
we may reply that some inconsistency in such punctuation
does not in the least affect the value of the proper
use of marks where they have real worth. A discussion
of these seemingly minor points bears this value,
that it may show niceties in grouping overlooked in
our discussion of sharply defined groups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>No comma is required after “holds” in No. 39
because there is no grouping of words in the sentence
that requires to be made in order to show a relation
different from the relation that exists in the simplest
form of expression, such, for instance, as the relation
of adjective to noun, noun to verb, verb to object,
etc.</p>

<p>In Sentence 40 “that” does not grow out of or
coalesce with “is” as “that” grows out of and coalesces
with “holds” in No. 39. The reader almost invariably
pauses after “is” in such relations, as if to group
into a whole what follows, such whole constituting
the predicate of the sentence. The comma serves to
show a grouping that is at once natural and helpful
in reading, whether aloud or silently. This relation,
with the need of the grouping, may be shown somewhat
more clearly in a sentence where the use of the
comma is quite unquestioned by good writers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>41. The benefit of a right good book depends upon
this, that its virtues just soak into the mind, and there
become a living, generative force.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us note that the relation here marked by a
comma is quite suggestive of two similar relations
which we indicated, respectively, by a colon (Sentence
26-3) and by a comma and dash (Sentence 34). It is
plain that the relation in each of the three sentences
(Nos. 26-3, 34, 41) is that of apposition; but it takes a
different form in each, and so we punctuate the three
sentences differently, each sentence falling into a
different class.</p>

<p>While the above sentences present no difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
in their punctuation, the punctuation of other sentences
quite like them seems to be somewhat puzzling,
yet it is based upon reason.</p>

<p>In court decisions the finding or findings generally
appear in a separate paragraph or paragraphs, following
a review of the case. The punctuation here is
not entirely uniform; but, although it seems inconsistent
with that of No. 39, it is easily explained:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>42. Held, that the evidence is material.</p></blockquote>

<p>If the decision covers two or more points, it may
take this form:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>42-1. Held—</p>

<p>1. That the evidence is material.</p>

<p>2. That the lower court did not err in its instructions
to the jury.</p></blockquote>

<p>If there is a reason for the use of a comma after
“held” in No. 42, the same reason seems to require a
comma after “held” in No. 42-1, the dash being used
for another purpose, to be considered later. A comma
is not used in No. 42-1, because its omission is the
<i>conventional</i> usage.</p>

<p>The punctuation of No. 42 probably follows the
mode of reading the sentence, a decided pause being
made after “held,” which would not be the case in
reading No. 39.</p>

<p>It could not be said that a colon after “this” in
No. 41 would not be good punctuation.</p>

<p>As we have said elsewhere, Mr. Wilson’s work is
very masterful and exhaustive, even though exceedingly
puzzling; and therefore we feel justified in drawing
frequent lessons from it. We take from it our next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
two illustrative sentences, which are so much alike
that we wonder how there can be a difference in their
punctuation after the verb followed by “that”:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>43. The writer just quoted says, that “the grammatical
pauses, which are addressed to the eye of the reader,
are insufficient for the speaker, who addresses himself to
the understanding ‘through the porches of the ear.’”</p>

<p>44. Mr. Maglathlin says that “the comma occurs
sometimes where there should be no pause in reading or
speaking; nor can the length of any required stop be
inferred with much certainty from the common stop-mark
used.”</p></blockquote>

<p>We fail to find a rule in Mr. Wilson’s work explaining
the use of the comma before “that” in No. 43.
The sentences, however, are taken, not from Mr.
Wilson’s illustrative examples, but from the text of
his work; and therefore the punctuation is more
likely a typographical error.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">FIRST, SECOND, WHEN, NOW, BECAUSE, ETC.</h3>

<p>Writers on punctuation seem to find the use of
marks required by such words as <i>first</i>, <i>second</i>, <i>when</i>,
<i>now</i>, <i>because</i>, etc., very puzzling; and their rules to
determine the punctuation are exceedingly puzzling
to the reader.</p>

<p>This punctuation falls quite readily under the
principles of grouping and relationship exemplified
in practically all of our illustrative sentences considered
up to this point. It will be seen that the
difficulty is to determine the actual relation of the
word to what precedes or follows, or to both. Illustrative
examples will serve to solve this difficulty:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>45. You ask me, perhaps, even you, who are all
charity, why parts of this book are what they are.</p>

<p>46. You ask me, perhaps even you, who are all
charity, why parts of this book are what they are.</p></blockquote>

<p>In No. 45 the speaker makes in the first three
words a statement which may be merely an assumption;
and, perceiving this fact as the statement is
finished, he wishes to soften the possible severity of his
language. This he does by the insertion of a <i>slightly</i>
parenthetical word (perhaps). Besides having this
parenthetical character, “perhaps” has here also a
squinting character (looking both ways),—that is, it
may be intended to qualify what precedes it or what
follows it. As it is entirely cut off by a comma from
what follows it, the reader must determine what it
does qualify; and this he readily determines from his
knowledge of language. Of course, it here qualifies
the statement that precedes it. If “perhaps” were
placed before “ask,” the meaning would be unmistakable;
but, as the effect of the language would not
be exactly the same, the former mode of expression
is necessary, and demands proper punctuation.</p>

<p>In No. 46 “perhaps” stands in the regular position
of a word that qualifies what immediately follows it,
and therefore needs no mark. The commas in this
sentence are used to <i>suspend</i> a group of words, as
diagrammatically illustrated in Sentence 4-3, coming
between words closely connected in sense. The
more natural position of this appositive group of
words is immediately after the first “you”; but even
here it would require the commas, because it is an
appositive. They are placed where they are for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
same reason that “perhaps” is placed out of its
natural order in No. 45.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>47. The word <i>therefore</i> sometimes stands, as an
adverb, in the natural position of an adverb, and therefore
requires no mark, at least after it; it likewise stands,
as a conjunction, in the natural position of a conjunction,
and therefore no mark is required after it; it also sometimes
stands, as either part of speech, out of the regular
order of such part of speech, breaking the continuous
flow of the thought, and thus becoming <i>slightly</i> parenthetical
and requiring the marks (commas) used to show
this office of the word. If, therefore, this distinction
between the word’s uses be carefully noted, the punctuation
required will not be difficult to learn.</p></blockquote>

<p>The above sentence will serve to illustrate the
punctuation required by “therefore” and also by its
synonyms, which are <i>accordingly</i>, <i>because</i>, <i>hence</i>,
<i>since</i>, <i>thence</i>, <i>wherefore</i>, etc. These words belong to
a large group of words whose punctuation is readily
determined by the sense relations. The word <i>however</i>,
in its relation to other parts of the sentence,
will serve to emphasize the distinction between the
two uses of many of these words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>48. He was reluctant to discuss the subject. He
replied, however, to all questions put to him, however
pointed such questions were.</p></blockquote>

<p>This sentence may be so formed as to bring the
first “however” into the usual position of the conjunction:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>48-1. He was reluctant to discuss the subject; however,
he replied to all questions put to him, however
pointed such questions were.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this form, another word, <i>but</i>, <i>yet</i>, <i>although</i>, or
the like, would be preferred to the first “however.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>The relation indicated by the word <i>because</i> is
easily misunderstood, and therefore often wrongly
indicated in the punctuation by the presence or
absence of a mark. The meaning of a sentence may
thus be entirely changed by the punctuation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>49. John did not go to town because his father was
absent.</p>

<p>49-1. John did not go to town, because his father
was absent.</p></blockquote>

<p>No. 49 asserts that John went to town, and states
that his reason for going was not his father’s absence.
No. 49-1 asserts that John did <i>not</i> go to town, and
that the reason for not going was his father’s absence.
In No. 49 the language is used in its natural order and
without any turn in the thought, which is not complete
until the end of the sentence is reached. In
No. 49-1 the same language is made to give an
entirely different meaning by changing the relation
between the two groups of words constituting the
sentence. A like change of real meaning is seen in
Sentences 13 and 13-1; and a like change of apparent
meaning is seen in Sentences 1 and 1-1. This principle
is clearly exemplified in Sentences 11-1 and
11-2.</p>

<p>A very important principle of language is involved
in this punctuation; and we should thoroughly comprehend
it. In No. 49 the relation expressed by
“not” goes on to the group of words beginning with
“because,” although apparently confined to “go.”
In No. 49-1 the relation is confined entirely to “go.”
We find a counterpart of this form of expression in
the use of “only” and similar modifiers. “Only” is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
used out of place so generally, often by excellent
writers, that we hesitate to criticize such usage. In
the expression, <i>I only assisted the boys to work the example</i>,
we are not sure whether the writer means to
say that he <i>only</i> assisted,—that is, did not do all
the work; or that he assisted <i>only</i> the boys,—that
is, not the girls; or that he assisted them <i>only</i> to
work the example, and not to explain it.</p>

<p>A careful writer will always avoid such ambiguous
expressions, for it is not easy for the reader to differentiate
the meanings in such sentences as Nos. 49
and 49-1.</p>

<p class="tb">Our next two sentences (Nos. 50 and 51) are
especially interesting because of their sources. No. 50
is a part of Mr. Teall’s general rule (page 1) for the
use of the comma; and No. 51 is a sentence from the
text of Mr. Wilson’s work (page 3), quoted by Mr.
Teall in the discussion of his own rule.</p>

<p>We quote No. 50, not to consider it as a rule, but
to consider the use of the comma in its language.
No. 51, as it appears in Mr. Wilson’s work, has a
comma before “unless”; and Mr. Teall quotes the
sentence to illustrate an erroneous use of the comma:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>50. When there is no break in sense no comma
should be used, unless necessary for clearness of expression.</p>

<p>51. Scarcely can a sentence be perused with satisfaction
or interest, unless pointed with some degree of
accuracy.</p></blockquote>

<p>No. 50, like No. 49-1, is practically completed
at the comma, what follows in each being added as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
an additional thought. In No. 51 the language up
to the comma is almost meaningless, or, at least,
makes an untrue statement. What follows the
comma <i>restricts</i> the assertion to a definite and true
statement, just as what follows the comma in No. 49
<i>restricts</i> the meaning of the assertion made in the
language preceding it. Because of this relation between
the parts no comma is used, and for the reasons
already discussed.</p>

<p>Sentences 50 and 51 are not unlike Sentences 13
and 13-1; and therefore the same reasoning determines
their punctuation.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson’s use of a comma before “unless” in
No. 51 is wrong, and is contrary to one of his own
rules.</p>

<p>Such mistakes can be found, probably, in the text-book
of every writer on punctuation. They are
generally mere oversights, and should not be construed
as evidence of the writer’s lack of knowledge.
It is the system of a writer which determines the
value or lack of value of his work.</p>

<p class="tb">The punctuation between clauses connected by
<i>when</i>, <i>where</i>, and like connectives, presents difficulties
only when an attempt is made to rob such connectives
of their apparent meanings, respectively, of
time and place, as is done by some writers, and perhaps
correctly in rare cases.</p>

<p class="tb">In each of our next three illustrative sentences the
thought of time is equally manifest; and therefore
there is no more need of a comma in one than in
the other:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>52. You may fire <i>when</i> you are ready, Gridley.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>52-1. You may fire <i>now</i>, Gridley.</p>

<p>52-2. You may go <i>tomorrow</i>, Gridley.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is true that “when” may lose, at least in a
measure, its sense of time, and then indicate a somewhat
different relation between the clauses it connects.
Mr. Wilson gives the following sentence to illustrate
this point:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>53. Refrain not to speak, when by speaking you may
be useful to others.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here “when” may not refer to time, but may be
equivalent to <i>if</i>, thus introducing a condition under
which to speak; or it may be equivalent to <i>because</i>,
thus giving a reason. Such meaning would make a
sentence very much like No. 49-1.</p>

<p>We find an exact counterpart of No. 53, with
similar punctuation, in the following sentence from
the New Testament, Common Version:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>53-1. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you.</p></blockquote>

<p>The same sentence in the Revised Version appears
without the comma, thus giving “when” its full sense
of time:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>53-2. Blessed are ye when men shall reproach you.</p></blockquote>

<p>In Sentence 47 we saw the various uses of the word
“therefore”; and in Sentences 48 and 48-1 we saw the
different meanings of “however” with a change of
position. In our next five or six sentences, we shall
see that the meaning to be conveyed determines the
relation, this relation being indicated by the mark of
punctuation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>54. Fortunately for me, the work was easy.</p>

<p>54-1. Fortunately, for me the work was easy.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>In No. 54 the good fortune (fortunately) is for
me, as if the language read, “It was fortunate for me.”
In 54-1 the comma cuts “fortunately” off from “for
me”; and the meaning is thus changed.</p>

<p>If the meaning of No. 54-1 is not perfectly clear to
the reader, it may be made so by a change in the
form of the sentence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>54-2. Fortunately, the work was easy for me.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sentence 54 is not capable of such transposition;
and this shows that the sentences are different in
meaning.</p>

<p>Words and groups of words like this and in like
use are very numerous; yet practically all of them
readily fall into their respective classes, and are easily
punctuated. A change in meaning, however, even
without a change in form, will require different
punctuation, although the proper punctuation is rarely
seen. That it is so seems strange in view of the fact
that the meaning logically permits of no other than
the obviously correct punctuation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>55. In conclusion, I wish to say that the evidence
does not justify the verdict.</p></blockquote>

<p>The relation of “in conclusion” will be clearly seen
if we transfer the term:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>55-1. I wish to say, in conclusion, that the evidence
does not justify the verdict.</p></blockquote>

<p>In each of these sentences “in conclusion” is
merely an adverb equivalent to <i>finally</i>. If we make
it equivalent to a clause, and thus prevent its performing
the office of an adverb, its relation is changed,
and its new relation will determine the punctuation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Such a change and such new relation are seen in the
next sentence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>55-2. In conclusion: the jury seemed unable to
comprehend either the evidence or the charge of the judge;
the judge was not entirely free from prejudice; and the
prisoner was unable to obtain important evidence.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here “in conclusion” seems to bear no grammatical
relation to what follows. It is, however, the remnant
of a clause which bears the <i>colon</i> relation to what
follows; and therefore the colon is used after it.
Such a clause might read thus, “I will state, in conclusion,
the facts in the case.”</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">YES, NO, AGAIN, ETC.</h3>

<p>The words <i>yes</i>, <i>no</i>, <i>again</i>, <i>to sum up</i>, <i>to proceed</i>,
etc., are often used in this way, and so require the
colon:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>56. Do you think he will meet the expectations of his
friends? Yes: he has never failed to meet reasonable
expectations.</p></blockquote>

<p>Apparently in the absence of a comprehension of
the <i>colon</i> relation between “yes” or “no” and what
follows, even careful punctuators seem to prefer
the semicolon after these words; and, it may be said,
convention thus overrides reason, making the semicolon
far more common than the colon for this punctuation.</p>

<p>The conventional punctuation of the sentence is
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>56-1. Do you think he will meet the expectations of
his friends? Yes; he has never failed to meet reasonable
expectations.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>As marks are used mainly to assist the reader in
so grouping words that their relations may be readily
seen, it is apparent that a mark is not needed when
the grouping is unmistakable in its absence. There
is a large class of groups so formed and so connected
that a mark of punctuation between them is superfluous,
although used quite in accordance with our
general principle, as exemplified in Sentences 1 and
1-1. The following sentence exhibits such grouping:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>57. The author was identified with Maine in blood
and spirit and in the ideals of life.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this sentence the first “and” clearly connects
“blood” and “spirit,” forming a group governed by
the preposition “in.” Because of the absence of a
mark before the second “and,” the reader, in view of
what has been said in our discussion, might expect
the word following the second “and” to have the same
sense relation to “spirit” that “spirit” bears to
“blood.” If such relation does not exist, then why
should not a comma be used to notify the reader of
the fact, as one was used in Sentence 1-1? The
reason is, that marks are used to prevent wrong
groupings which are easily made because of apparent,
but wrong, relations. When the eye does not need
a mark, the mark should be omitted, even though
consistency in punctuation seems to call for it.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that “in blood and spirit” makes
in itself a complete group and a complete picture (the
material and the immaterial), thus practically inhibiting
the use of a third coördinate word connected
by “and”; moreover, the word “in” following the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
second “and” at once notifies the reader that another
<i>in</i> group is to follow the conjunction. For these reasons
there is no liability even to momentary wrong
grouping, and therefore no mark is needed before the
second “and.” This principle may be applied to
somewhat long groups, if similarly formed, even though
the words beginning the groups are not the same.
This applies especially to groups formed by the correlative
conjunctions, such as <i>either—or</i>, <i>neither—nor</i>, etc.,
the first conjunction giving notice that its correlative
is to introduce a group bound to the preceding group
by the expected complementary conjunction.</p>

<p>If we closely followed the principle exemplified
in Sentence 1-1, a comma would be required before
the second “and” in No. 57. Such use of marks
would be very “close” punctuation, which means
subservience to rules based upon an apparent principle.
Close punctuation often becomes confusing
by making so many groups of the words in a sentence
that such groups are not readily grasped and properly
joined together by the reader. The same effect is
produced by the use of too many short sentences
in a paragraph, for the relations existing between such
sentences is not easily apprehended. Striving after
short sentences is a common fault of many modern
writers.</p>

COMMA, SEMICOLON, COLON, AND PERIOD—THEIR DIFFERENTIATION</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> has already been seen, we determine what
mark of punctuation is helpful at any point in written
or printed language by the sense relation between
two groups of words and by the degree of separation
between such groups. The degrees of separation
cannot be so accurately classified that there will not
be much apparent and some real inconsistency in the
punctuation of the most careful writer, and much
more in the uses of marks by different writers.</p>

<p>We shall consider these points in this chapter,
in order to show (1) the cause of this inconsistency;
(2) how, in some measure, it may be avoided; and (3)
that much of it is wholly immaterial, being not in
the least misleading.</p>

<p>A diagrammatic grouping indicated by the coordinate
conjunction <i>and</i>, with or without one of the
four principal marks, may help to illustrate the above
points and to differentiate, to some extent, the uses
of the marks:</p>

<p>What does the absence of a mark before “and” in
Diagram 1, and what does each of the marks in the
other diagrams, say to the reader, even before he has
seen enough of what follows the conjunction to enable
him to apprehend the probable grouping?</p>

<p>We, of course, know that “and” connects words
and groups of words which are coördinate in sense, and
that such groups are often similar in form. Similarity
in form with similarity of relationship in groups of
words makes reading easy; and much attention is
given to it by good writers.</p>

<p>In Diagram 1 “and” stands between two words or
groups of words whose apparent relation is quite
unmistakable for their real relation, which was not the
case in Sentence 1, which therefore required a mark
of punctuation. In other words, no mistake can be
made, and therefore no mark is needed. However
this diagram may be filled out, “and” joins words or
groups of words into a single group, such new group
being related to some other word or group in the
sentence.</p>

<p>Diagram 2 gives notice of a grouping different
from that in Diagram 1; and Diagrams 3, 4, and 5
exhibit still other groupings.</p>

<p>We saw, particularly in Sentences 7, 7-1, and
7-2, a simple grouping which plainly required another
and a larger mark than the comma. We saw
another kind of grouping in other sentences which
also unmistakably required a mark other than the
semicolon.</p>

<p>We now come to discuss the basis of differentiating
our principal marks, sometimes at points where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
choice of a mark is not always unmistakable. In
some cases the choice is based upon well-defined sense
relations; in other cases it is based upon shades of
meaning or upon degrees of separation not sufficiently
sharp to make the choice easy, especially under <i>rules</i>
for punctuation.</p>

<p>Sentence 1-1 is a good illustration of Diagram 2;
and yet the apparent relation between “children” and
their “mothers” might so strongly impress itself upon
the mind of an inexperienced reader, especially if reading
the sentence at sight and aloud, that the comma
would not prevent a momentary wrong combination
of these words. A semicolon before the conjunction
would prevent the liability to such error, and probably
do so even with the most inexperienced reader.
Thus we have a choice between the comma and the
semicolon in Sentence 1; and this choice rests upon
the degree of liability to error, which cannot be the
same with different classes of readers. Liability to
error in grouping is increased by a closeness of <i>apparent</i>
relations that are <i>wrong</i> relations, and also
by a reader’s lack of expertness in grouping language
at sight. In view of these facts, we think
the use of a semicolon in Sentence 1 better punctuation
than the use of a comma; but the use of the
semicolon in this particular sentence should not be
made to justify a rule requiring a semicolon between
every two clauses connected by a conjunction, or
between two clauses so connected, one of which contains
one or more commas.</p>

<p class="tb">Our next sentence is taken from an essay, in a
high-class magazine, by the professor of English in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
a leading eastern university; and this essay has for
its title “Writing English”:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>58. The boy must be able to say what he knows, or
write what he knows, or he does not know it.</p></blockquote>

<p>As written and punctuated, this sentence contains
three apparently coördinate groups of words, the
groups being connected by “or,” and the grouping
indicated by commas. It is, however, composed of
only two main groups, the first of the two groups
being regrouped into other groups. Such grouping
should always be shown by the punctuation; for, when
it is not so shown, the sentence cannot be read without
some distractive effect upon the reader and, if
read aloud, also upon the hearer.</p>

<p>The failure of this sentence to read smoothly, or
without distractive effect, arises from the usual
cause: the form of the language leads the reader to
look forward to a mode of development of the sentence
which does not follow,—that is, the <i>apparent</i> mode
of development, as exhibited in the grouping, is not
the <i>real</i> mode of development. As each of the second
and third groups is introduced by “or” and preceded
by a comma, the reader is led to look for the same
relation between the second and third groups that
exists between the first and second. He is thus led
to expect a group in a series, which does not follow.</p>

<p>The distractive effect of the sentence can be
removed in some degree by writing it in the following
form, the added “to” giving the second group a form
similar to that of the first:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>58-1. The boy must be able to say or <i>to</i> write what
he knows, or he does not know it.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>In this condensed form the sentence lacks, at the
point of condensation, the emphasis of the original;
and therefore the sentence is not so effective in its
statement of a truth. If, then, the original form is
preferred, its distractive effect can be removed by
the use of punctuation that properly groups its parts:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>58-2. The boy must be able to say what he knows,
or write what he knows; or he does not know it.</p></blockquote>

<p>The semicolon here <i>disconnects</i> the second group
from the third, giving the third group connection
with a larger group, the first and second combined.</p>

<p>The need of the semicolon in No. 58-2 is not
determined by the presence of the preceding comma,
but mainly by the apparent relations of the groups,
such apparent relations being emphasized by the
presence of the second “or,” which makes the three
groups appear to be in a series. If these groups were
in a series, the second “or” would connect the second
and third groups. The semicolon at once throws
the grouping into two parts, thus making the second
“or” connect all that precedes with all that follows.</p>

<p>Although the writer of Sentence 58 appears to
have placed no value upon the <i>like</i> formation of the
first two groups of this sentence, nor to have recognized
the differentiation of the comma from the semicolon,
he uses both of these devices in a sentence,
quite like the above, in the next paragraph of his
essay. It is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>59. It is here that composition is of service to the
imagination, and incidentally to culture; and I should
speak more largely of this service if there were space in
this essay to bring forward all the aspects of college composition.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>The need of the semicolon in both Nos. 58 and 59
is, we think, unmistakable.</p>

<p>The comma in No. 59 has no value for the
reader. There is no <i>apparent</i> and <i>wrong</i> meaning
here requiring this comma; and it is difficult to
see how any wrong grouping, in the absence of the
comma, is likely to be made by the reader. If this
comma were challenged for its meaning we do not
know what answer it could give.</p>

<p>The absence of a comma after “imagination”
would give notice to the reader that what has been
said about “imagination” is to be said about something
else in the <i>and</i> relation to “imagination.”
The writer, wishing to qualify the added statement,
does so before the statement is made, thus throwing
matter (one word in this case) between what has preceded
and what is to be grouped with “imagination,”
as shown by the absence of a mark before “and.”
This makes the qualifying word a modified parenthesis.
Such treatment of the word, indicated by
marks, gives a shade of meaning difficult to express
in language. The difference is, perhaps, in the
emphasis gained by the punctuation.</p>

<p>We should write the sentence in the following way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>59-1. It is here that composition is of service to the
imagination and, incidentally, to culture; and I should
speak more largely....</p></blockquote>

<p>Our next sentence, which is taken from a well-known
literary paper, is punctuated so badly that we
wonder how it could pass an experienced proof-reader:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>60. Providence made him a waif on London streets
and later, a waif on the ocean, she taught him the feeling
of a rope’s end on a naked back.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>When the reader reaches “and” in this sentence
he needs to be informed by a mark of punctuation
that what immediately follows the conjunction looks
forward, not backward, for its connection. Such
notice is always imperative when the words immediately
following the conjunction may readily be
attached by the reader to what precedes, but belong
to what follows. In this sentence “a waif on the
ocean” readily becomes the object of “made”; and
even a very careful reader might so connect it, not
discovering his mistake until he reached “she taught
him.” “Later” apparently looks backward to
“made”; but its connection is forward.</p>

<p>Properly punctuated the sentence reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>60-1. Providence made him a waif on London
streets; and, later, a waif on the ocean, she taught him
the feeling of a rope’s end on a naked back.</p></blockquote>

<p>“Later” takes a comma before it because it is out
of its natural order and also because it is placed in a
position where it obstructs the smoothness of the
language. The position of both “later” and “a waif
on the ocean” gives force and beauty to the language;
but they entangle, to a certain extent, the principal
words of the sentence, thus requiring marks of punctuation
to point out the proper relation between
such words, as in Sentence 4-2.</p>

<p>Diagram 4 covers the punctuation exemplified in
Sentence 6,—that is, punctuation based upon the rank
of the colon.</p>

<p>The use of the colon that is properly differentiated
from the uses of the semicolon and the period,
respectively, is the use determined by its rank. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
particular use is exemplified in Sentences 6 and 6-2
and, to some extent, in Sentences 26-3 and 27-1.
Writers who ignore the latter use of the colon—and
they are many in number—apparently ignore the real
relations between the parts of a sentence or of a
composition; or, if they themselves see and appreciate
such relations, they are willing to leave them obscurely
expressed. It is quite probable that many writers
do not know that marks of punctuation have inherent
meanings which clearly express these relations. The
lack of such knowledge is explained by the almost
total absence of any discussion of the matter in the
text-books on punctuation.</p>

<p>Our statement that Sentences 26-3 and 27-1
illustrate only “to some extent” the rank of the colon
among the principal marks, may need explanation.
In Sentences 6 and 6-2 the colon is used because a
mark larger than the semicolon is required to group
the parts of each sentence, one part being subdivided
by semicolons. This use is wholly one of rank, and
clearly differentiates the use of the mark. It is another
sense relation of the parts of each of the other sentences
(Nos. 26-3 and 27-1) that requires the colon,
and not the presence of a semicolon in one of the
parts. The colon would still be the only mark with
an inherent meaning expressive of the relation between
the parts even if there were no other mark in either
sentence. The colon would still be the proper mark
in No. 26-3 if it ended with “old,” and in No. 27-1 if
it ended with “evasions.” The relation between the
two groups following the colon in No. 26-3 is the
<i>and</i> relation, each group being an expansion of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
picture in the main group,—that is, the first group (it
never grows old) explains “perpetual charm,” and the
second group (it never loses its novelty) explains “singular
charm.” In No. 27-1 a conjunction (but) is
present to show the sense relation at that point.</p>

<p class="tb">Our next sentence, which is from Balzac, will
illustrate the points we are considering, and also show
the difficulties the punctuator meets in the punctuation
of language which he may not change:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>61. He was all that a hero should be; he suffered
long, and came into his own, and he has been, in a measure,
the world’s ideal of a heroic man of arms.</p></blockquote>

<p>According to most rules of punctuation based
upon grammatical relations, this punctuation is correct;
according to the principles of punctuation based
upon sense relations, this punctuation is very bad.
The obscurity in the meaning of the language cannot
be wholly removed by punctuation. Two simple
statements are made in the sentence, and are coördinated
by the second conjunction (and); but the
language is so grouped by the punctuation as to conceal
this fact. We can show the meaning by a different
mode of punctuation, which, however, is not
good punctuation. Such punctuation will show the
relation because the meaning of the marks used is
familiar to most readers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>61-1. He was all that a hero should be (he suffered
long, and came into his own); and he has been, in a
measure, the world’s idea of a heroic man of arms.</p></blockquote>

<p>The parentheses show the relation of the matter
so enclosed to what has preceded; but the matter so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
set off is not a parenthesis, and therefore the use of
the marks of parenthesis is not good punctuation.
It is true that the matter so set off is explanatory
matter; but it is an expansion of the idea preceding
it, and therefore should be preceded by a colon.</p>

<p>Having determined that a colon is the proper
mark after this first group of words, we must then
determine where the second group ends. It is quite
evident that “came into his own” is joined to
“suffered long,” even though <i>coming into one’s own</i>
is no part of what constitutes a hero. We simply
accept the words at Balzac’s estimate.</p>

<p>The meaning of the next group, introduced by the
second “and,” is unmistakable; and the group is coordinate
in sense, and is connected by the conjunction,
with all that precedes. If the group preceding the
conjunction is subdivided by a colon, even though the
colon here is not used solely because of its rank, it is
well to ignore this technicality, and use a period, thus
unmistakably and properly grouping the language.</p>

<p>This reasoning would give us the following punctuation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>61-2. He was all that a hero should be: he suffered
long, and came into his own. And he has been, in a
measure, the world’s ideal of a heroic man of arms.</p></blockquote>

<p>The period here connects the second sentence
with <i>all</i> of the preceding sentence, at once disconnecting
the second sentence from the second clause
of the first sentence, of which it is made an unmistakable
part in the original sentence (No. 61).</p>

<p>This sentence illustrates the loose grouping common
to many of our best writers; and it also shows that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
marks of punctuation, if possessing clearly understood
meanings, cannot be adjusted to loose groupings.</p>

<p class="tb">If the colon in No. 61-2 were considered like the
colon in No. 25, and thus held subordinate to the
semicolon, a semicolon would be preferable to the
period that follows; yet very few readers would grasp
such fine use of a mark in a sentence like No. 61-2.</p>

<p class="tb">Our next sentence illustrates a fault that is practically
the opposite of the above; and its punctuation
is much more common and even more distracting.
It is the fault of splitting up a sentence, making two
sentences out of one, or of carrying a part of one
sentence over into another sentence, making two
incomplete sentences. This fault grows out of an
effort to use short sentences, which some writers think
essential to clearness. It is quite safe to say few
sentences are too long if the relations between their
parts can clearly be shown by marks of punctuation.</p>

<p>We take the sentence from <i>The Outlook</i>. It appears
in Dr. Abbott’s “Reminiscences”; and, as Dr.
Abbott is noted as an unusually clear and forceful
writer, the sentence, with its context, is of special
interest:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>62. There were lawyers [in 1853-59] who promoted
quarrels to get fees. But they were the pariahs of the
profession. The best lawyers were peacemakers, and
though, of necessity, professional partisans when engaged
in litigation, they were generally honorable partisans.</p></blockquote>

<p>That the third of the above sentences grows out
of the first is clearly shown by the contrast between
the kinds of lawyers mentioned: the former promoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
<i>quarrels</i>; the latter were <i>peacemakers</i>. Note also
that each class is qualified: the first is qualified by
“but they were the pariahs”; the second by “and were
generally honorable partisans.” The “and,” which
introduces a really qualifying clause, might properly
have been “but,” to show that as “peacemakers” these
lawyers surrendered no rights of their clients, <i>but</i>
contended for such rights when necessary to become
“professional partisans.”</p>

<p>As the sentences are written, the third sentence
does not grow out of the sentence (the second) preceding
it, but out of the first sentence; and such
remoteness of parts standing in the close relation
required in a contrast, is distracting.</p>

<p>We used a period in No. 61-2 because “and”
there connects two complete sentences standing in
the <i>and</i> relation to each other. We object to the use
of a period in No. 62 where the conjunction (but)
connects two sentences which are properly only one,
and should be so written.</p>

<p>The points we wish to make may be seen by a
slight change in the sentence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>62-1. There were lawyers who promoted quarrels to
get fees; but they were the pariahs of the profession. The
best lawyers were peacemakers; but, when engaged in litigation
and it became necessary, they were professional
partisans, though they were generally honorable partisans.</p></blockquote>

<p>In order to see more clearly the differentiation
between relations that require the semicolon and
those that require the colon, let us study these relations
in two sentences properly punctuated with each
of the two marks:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>63. The only true equalizers in the world are books;
the only treasure-house open to all comers is a library;
the only wealth which will not decay is knowledge.</p>

<p>64. Here was a superintendent worth having: when
he did not find good tools, he made them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Why not use commas or periods in No. 63? Why
not use a semicolon in No. 64?</p>

<p>Perhaps we have not made, and cannot make,
the differentiation between the comma and the semicolon
sufficiently definite to answer the first question,
especially as the formation of each of the three clauses
is such that the liability to error in reading them is
very slight. It would be rather dogmatic to assert
that the use of commas here would be poor punctuation;
yet the degree of separation between the groups
is so marked as to make the relations more like the
relations between groups that we have seen to require
a semicolon than like relations between groups separated
by a comma. The degree of separation here
almost approaches the degree that takes the period;
and therefore the semicolon seems much better than
the comma.</p>

<p>But why not periods? Two positive answers may
be given. The three clauses constitute one complete
idea, and therefore make a sentence. If set off by
periods, thus making three sentences, no fourth sentence
could be formed to follow the third and maintain
sentence unity; for the fourth sentence would necessarily
grow out of the third, while its logical relation
would be to the three clauses. Such a fault would be
that seen in Sentence 62.</p>

<p>Why not a semicolon in No. 64? Because, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
our classifications and definitions, the colon, when its
use is not determined by its rank, as it is in Sentence
6, is used to show a relation that is practically that of
apposition, exhibited, in different forms, in Sentences
25 and 26-3. “A good superintendent” is explained
by the expanded clause following the colon, just as
“articles” in No. 25 is explained by the details that
follow the colon.</p>

<p>In most sentences like No. 64 the second clause
can be tied to the first by a conjunction (for, as, etc.);
but the exact idea is not thus expressed. While this
would sometimes show the sense relation between
the clauses, it would distinctly weaken the force
and beauty of the language, tending to make the
second clause a specific, rather than a general, statement.</p>

<p>The differentiation between the semicolon and
the colon in Nos. 63 and 64 is very clear if we recognize
the colon as the mark of apposition or explanation.
In No. 63 other clauses are added to the first to add
other thoughts; in No. 64 the added clause repeats
the thought of the first by way of amplification of
such thought.</p>

<p>The greatest value of a mark of punctuation lies
in its ability to indicate a meaning that depends upon
the relation of one group of words to another; and so
long as language has a literary value, just so long will
the colon be useful as an aid in the expression of
thought. This is illustrated in our next sentence
(No. 65), where a semicolon, instead of the colon,
would suggest the <i>and</i> relation, and thus make havoc
of the sense:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>65. Ethics has no summons to righteousness: it
knows nothing of truth spiritually discerned.</p></blockquote>

<p>If a period were used here, instead of the colon,
the relation between the two sentences (clauses
formed into sentences by the use of the period)
might easily be taken for the <i>and</i> relation. With
such relation between the clauses, the first clause
would make a vague assertion, which, without an
explanation, would convey no definite meaning.</p>

<p>In our discussion of Sentence 6 we saw that the
colon, preceding “but,” made the <i>but</i> relation extend
back over several clauses separated by semicolons.
“But” may begin a sentence, a paragraph, a part of
a book, or even a volume. When beginning any one
of such groups, the <i>but</i> relation should be a well-defined
sense relation between the groups so connected.
If “but” begins a paragraph, the sense relation
must be between the two paragraphs connected
by the conjunction. Such relation is rarely sustained
between long paragraphs; and it does not
exist between sentences nearly so often as it is indicated
by the use of the conjunction and the period.</p>

<p><i>But</i>, <i>and</i>, and <i>for</i> are the principal conjunctions thus
used, although others are not infrequently so used.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">COMMA AND SEMICOLON</h3>

<p>The differentiation of the semicolon from the
colon, and the colon from the period, seems to be so
well marked that a choice between them is rarely
difficult to make in the punctuation of language with
proper sense relations between its parts; but the
differentiation between the comma and the semicolon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
is not so well defined, yet it is generally very clear
in well-written English. Here the choice of a mark
is determined, very largely, by the degree of separation
between the groups. In order further to illustrate
this point, let us compare No. 63 with a sentence
which is quite like it, and yet requires only a
comma between its clauses:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>66. Experience is fallacious, and judgment difficult.</p></blockquote>

<p>The first three words of the above form a clause
which so completely expresses a thought that the
addition, by means of the “and,” of another adjective
to follow “fallacious,” is hardly suggested. On the
other hand, this degree of completeness might suggest
that what is to follow will be a complete clause so
changing the direction of the thought as to require a
semicolon to show the fact of the change. Let us
look at the sentence diagrammatically:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>66-1. Experience is fallacious and....</p></blockquote>

<p>How will this sentence probably continue? This
question confronts every intelligent reader, whether
he realizes it or not, when reading the complete sentence.
If the mark before “and,” or the absence of a
mark, conveys to him no information upon this point,
he learns only through a tiresome mental process of
ascertaining the correct relation of the words that
follow “and” to the words that precede it. This
process is one of holding in suspense two or more possible
combinations. It is always distractive, and very
often ends in a wrong combination. A semicolon before
“and” would suggest that the preceding group of
words is complete in itself, and is to be followed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
a complete and coördinate thought (“and” indicates
the coördination) in the proper sense relation with
the group that has preceded. It would at once
preclude the expectation of an adjective coördinate
with “fallacious.”</p>

<p>We may complete the sentence thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>66-2. Experience is fallacious; and therefore it is
difficult for us to form correct judgments based upon
experience.</p></blockquote>

<p>To exhibit at once the sense relation between the
two groups of words in the above (the relation of correct
judgment to experience), we inserted the word
“therefore”; to show that “and” is to be followed by
a group grammatically coördinate with what precedes
it, and of like form, we used a semicolon.</p>

<p>If the relation between the groups were closer than
the relation suggested by the semicolon, but not so
close as indicated by the absence of a mark, the
comma would logically be the proper mark. It would
suggest neither a word to be grouped with “fallacious”
nor a clause to be grouped with all that precedes
“and.” It would suggest a different development
of the sentence. Such development would tie
what follows to a <i>part</i>, not to the <i>whole</i>, of what precedes;
and, as there are but three words in this sentence
preceding the mark, what follows must be tied to one
of them, and not to the whole, as in No. 66-2. Two
sentences will serve to illustrate the point:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>66-3. Experience is fallacious, and may not safely be
depended upon in the formation of correct judgment.</p>

<p>66-4. Experience is fallacious, and unreliable as a
basis of correct judgment.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>In No. 66-3 the comma notifies the reader that
another adjective in the <i>and</i> relation to “fallacious,”
is not to follow.</p>

<p>In No. 66-4 the comma is used to confine “as a
basis of correct judgment” to “unreliable,” thus
disconnecting it from “fallacious.” This makes the
language say that experience is fallacious <i>in all things</i>,
and unreliable <i>only</i> as a basis of correct judgment.</p>

<p>If the reasoning in our discussion on the differentiation
of the comma from the semicolon, be correct,
it seems to establish a rule that the semicolon is the
mark of choice between two clauses, whether joined
by a conjunction or not. It is not entirely the length
or the character of the groups of words that determines
the choice. The liability to make wrong
combinations, especially such combinations as are
suggested by the apparent meaning of the language,
is to be lessened by the mark.</p>

<p>In the absence of a mark in Sentence 1, a momentary
wrong combination is quite unavoidable, because
perfectly good sense is made by the wrong grouping.
As a comma before “and” may not give to every
reader notice of the development of the sentence, and
as a semicolon could hardly fail to do so, it would
seem to be the better mark.</p>

<p>In neither No. 66-3 nor No. 66-4 can the reader
definitely interpret the meaning of the comma until
one or two words following the conjunction are
reached. As the process of determining a relation
from a mark often requires the reader to consider the
mark and one or two words following it, which process
becomes almost instantaneous, a comma may thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
convey its purpose as readily as the semicolon in No.
66-2 tells its purpose.</p>

<p>A slight change in the language of Sentence 1 will
not change either the names of the two groups
(clauses) or their relation (coördination); but it will
remove the liability, even the possibility, of such
wrong combination as is suggested in Sentence 1:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>66-5. Respect the rights of children and you will gain
their respect.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this sentence, a mark before “and” is not
really needed as a warning to the reader not to connect
“you” with “children,” thus making “you” an
object of the preposition “of.”</p>

<p>The similarity in form between Nos. 1 and 66-5,
with a mark of punctuation imperative in the first,
suggests the use of a mark in the second. As the
comma is here quite sufficient to prevent a wrong
combination by the reader, the comma naturally
becomes the mark of choice; and good convention
confirms this choice, while convention not so good
seems to ignore the need of the semicolon in similarly
formed sentences in which the <i>apparent</i> and <i>wrong</i>
grouping is much more marked than in Sentence 1.</p>

<p>Sentences 66 and 66-5 stand at one extreme of the
class of sentences in the punctuation of which we seek to
differentiate between the comma and the semicolon.
The relation is made quite unmistakable by the shortness
and completeness of the first group of words, and
also by the fact that the word in each sentence following
the conjunction does not suggest, even in the
slightest degree, a connection for itself with anything
that precedes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>Let us consider a sentence at the other extreme,
where a wrong combination is wholly unavoidable
without a semicolon, and quite suggestive with one:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>66-6. I do not mean that the people are conscious
of this fact; but that the leaders of the people are conscious
of it, I think, there is no doubt.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this sentence a semicolon is quite indispensable
in order to disconnect the second group beginning
with “that” from “mean,” to which the preceding
similarly formed group, beginning with “that,” belongs.</p>

<p>Between these extremes are many sentences which
may take either the comma or the semicolon without
distractive effect. The close punctuator will generally
prefer the semicolon; the open punctuator, the comma.
(For a discussion of close and open punctuation, see
Chapter XV.)</p>

<p>The degrees of variation in the relationship between
parts of language are so great that a differentiation
between the comma and the semicolon is at
times almost impossible. Fortunately, a quite indiscriminate
use of these two marks in the class of sentences
under consideration is not always misleading
or distractive to the reader; but the indiscriminate
use of marks tends to lessen the importance attached
by a reader to punctuation.</p>

<p class="small">In each of the first four examples above the relation between
its groups is indicated by a conjunction; and the grouping is so
readily apparent that the comma serves to show it.</p>

<p class="small">In No. 4-1, in the absence of a conjunction, the semicolon
at once shows that another clause is to follow as in No. 7, below.
Such clause, however, is contracted by the omission of a group
of words common to the two clauses. This omission is indicated
by a comma in the second clause, which also shows that the two
words in the group are not in any grammatical relation to each
other.</p>

<p class="small">In the first group of No. 5 we have a double object of the
verb (explained later as requiring no comma), and the object
is repeated, in form, in what follows the comma. The comma
may be said to be used to indicate the omitted verb, or, as in
Sentence 1-1, to indicate the relation.</p>

<p>10. Homer has not Shakespeare’s variations:

not when ambition is easy, but when it is hard. Fight
in darkness; fight when you are down; die hard, and
you won’t die at all.</p>

<p class="small">The comma before “and” in No. 12 divides the <i>semicolon</i>
group into two parts, and does not stand between groups coordinate
with the first and second groups.</p>

<p class="small">“Die hard, and you won’t die at all” is really a bull; and
the incongruity of ideas might well be expressed by a dash before
“and.”</p>

<p>13. All association [among people] must be a

traditional, are in constant flux, they either advance

<p class="small">The above sentence is thus punctuated in the Enclycopedia
Britannica and the New Standard Dictionary. We know of no
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>meaning of the comma that indicates the real sense relation between
“in constant flux” and what follows. Nor is this relation
that shown by the colon; for a thing,—for instance, the
ocean,—may be <i>in constant flux</i>, and yet not either <i>advance</i> or
<i>decay</i>.</p>

<p class="small">The meaning of the language requires “and” after “flux,”
preferably with a semicolon before it.</p>

<p>15. Lily Dyer was a favorite with the village
folk; she had just the qualities to arouse admiration.
She was good and handsome and smart.</p>

<p class="small">In the above example the <i>semicolon</i> relation does not exist
between the groups of words (clauses) between which it is placed,
for the second group does not add something to the first to make
a complete thought. Moreover, the third group bears an unmistakable
relation to the second group; and such relation is
not the <i>period</i> relation. The language needs regrouping, to
show the sense relations:</p>

<p>15-1. Lily Dyer was a favorite with the village
folk. She had just the qualities to arouse admiration:
she was good and handsome and smart.</p>

<p>16. It is a party which is as yet without a name.
And what is even stranger, without a nickname.</p>

<p class="small">No. 16 is a somewhat extreme, though common, result of
seeking to make one’s sentences short. No mark at all is needed,
or permissible, before “and” in such a sentence:</p>

<p>16-1. It is a party without a name and, what is
even stranger, without a nickname.</p>

<p>17. Polemic is always dreary. Devotion always
interests. This is because men are nearly always
wrong when they want their own way, and always
partly right when they worship.</p>

<p class="small">As the third sentence in the above example does not grow
out of the sentence preceding it, sentence unity is destroyed;
and, besides, the use of “this” clearly shows reference to a
thought expressed in the <i>two</i> preceding sentences. A semicolon
is the proper mark after “dreary,” to make one sentence of the
two, out of which the third grows.</p>

<p>18. Milton does not paint a finished picture, or
play for a mere passive listener. He sketches, and
leaves others to fill up the outline. He strikes the
key-note, and expects his hearers to make out the
melody.</p>

<p class="small">In this example sentence unity is wholly disregarded: the
first picture is put into one sentence, instead of two; the second
picture is put into two sentences, instead of one. Moreover,
as the second picture is but an amplification of the first, both
pictures may be put into one sentence, and should be so put, in
accordance with the punctuation we have discussed.</p>

<p class="small">As now punctuated, the second sentence does not grow out
of the first, but out of the first half of the first; and the third
sentence, instead of growing out of the second, grows out of the
second half of the first, ignoring the second sentence entirely.</p>

<p class="small">Uniting the second and third sentences by a semicolon will
improve the grouping and the punctuation; but making one
sentence out of the three is still better:</p>

<p>18-1. Milton does not paint a finished picture,
or play for a mere passive listener: he sketches, and
leaves others to fill up the outline; he strikes the
key-note, and expects his hearers to make out the
melody.</p>

<p class="small">The relations between the groups may be shown in another
way; but such mode of expressing thought is not tolerable:</p>

<p>18-2. Milton does not paint a finished picture
(he sketches, and leaves others to fill up the outline),
or play for a mere passive listener (he strikes the
key-note, and expects his hearers to make out the
melody).</p>

COMMA, DASH, AND PARENTHESES—THEIR DIFFERENTIATION</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> know of no writer who has attempted to
differentiate the above marks; but some writers have
dismissed the subject by saying that these marks are
interchangeable. Such a statement, we believe, is
merely a confession of failure to comprehend the inherent
meanings of the marks, and the need of giving
marks definite meanings. The confusion resulting
from such failure is, at least at this point, chaos in
punctuation and, not infrequently, in the meaning
of language so punctuated.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrison,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> in his able <i>Atlantic</i> article, says:
“Dash, comma, and parenthesis have equal title to
employment in this sentence of Thackeray’s.” The
following is the sentence punctuated in the three ways
recognized by Mr. Garrison as correct punctuation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>67. If that theory be, and I have no doubt it is, the
right and safe one.</p>

<p>67-1. If that theory be (and I have no doubt it is)
the right and safe one.</p>

<p>67-2. If that theory be—and I have no doubt it is—the
right and safe one.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us first ask why any mark is required before
“and” in the sentence, and then what the mark, if
used, says to the writer. When the reader reaches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>the conjunction, two questions at once confront him:
First, does “and” connect the words between which
it immediately stands? second, does “and” carry the
<i>if</i> meaning over to the second group of words? As
“and” does not connect the words between which
it immediately stands, some mark is suggested; and
that mark is the comma, but a comma may not clearly
exclude <i>if</i> from the second group. If the <i>if</i> meaning
is not to be conveyed, a larger grouping is suggested;
and this would call for a semicolon, which would
<i>more widely</i> separate parts (subject and predicate) of
the whole sentence which should be held together.</p>

<p>The <i>and</i> relation is here what we may call a strained
one; in fact, the <i>and</i> relation hardly exists in this
sentence.</p>

<p>The punctuation of No. 67-1 is all right if we
accept a meaning of the term <i>parenthesis</i> that will
cover the group of words we are here dealing with;
but the punctuation is wholly wrong if we use marks
according to fundamental principles. Both the New
International and the New Standard dictionaries
give definitions of a parenthesis that are incomplete
and misleading. Their definitions are almost identical
in their wording, and call a parenthesis, in substance,
a group of words inserted, for explanation or
qualification, “in a sentence which would be grammatically
complete without it.” This definition
ignores both the root meaning of the word and the
common usage of the parenthesis. It is an excellent
definition for an <i>explanatory</i> word or group of words,
except a complete explanatory sentence, which we
set off by commas, as shown in our discussion of Sen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>tence
11 <i>et seq.</i> We do not know what would become,
under this definition, of a parenthesis in the form of
a complete sentence; for the definition confines the
parenthesis to a word or words inserted <i>in a sentence</i>.</p>

<p>The Century gives a definition that is based
upon the Greek roots of the word <i>parenthesis</i>, as well
as upon its use by good writers. According to this
definition, a parenthesis has <i>no grammatical</i> relation
with the language into which it is “put.” (The word
<i>thrust</i> would perhaps give a clearer idea of the original.)
We “parenthesize” in spoken, as well as in
written or printed, language; but in the former we
convey the meaning by inflections and pauses, while
in the latter we convey the meaning by marks of
punctuation.</p>

<p>The use of the conjunction (and) in the sentence
under consideration clearly takes the inserted group
of words out of the proper definition of a parenthesis;
for it puts such words into <i>grammatical</i> connection
with what precedes, although the words are quite
strongly parenthetical in nature.</p>

<p>Now, having eliminated the comma, the semicolon,
and the parentheses as the proper marks for
setting off this group of words <i>thrust</i> into the sentence,
and still making good sense by their grammatical
connection, how shall we punctuate them? It is
perfectly evident that this group of words makes a
decided <i>break</i> in the thread of the thought, and that
they do not have logical or natural connection with
what precedes, because the true <i>and</i> relation does not
exist between the thoughts, implied or expressed.
Such language may be said to be idiomatic and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>fore
proper; but the group of words is not properly
set off in either No. 67 or No. 67-1. As the fundamental
use of the dash is to note such a break in
language as here occurs, it is the proper mark before
“and” in this sentence. In language of this kind it
may be said that the writer <i>dashes</i> off the track of his
thought for a moment; and therefore the dash is the
proper mark to indicate such a break in the continuity
of thought.</p>

<p>The second dash is used to close the group in the
same way that the second comma of a pair of commas,
or the second part of the marks of parenthesis, is used;
and this makes the punctuation of No. 67-2 correct
punctuation, for it is based upon the fundamental
meanings of both the marks and the sense relations of
the words.</p>

<p>This careless use of the marks of parenthesis,
especially as in No. 67-1, is quite common in some
literary periodicals of high standing and in not a few
large printing establishments; but, we venture to
assert, it is rare among painstaking writers who
punctuate their own writings.</p>

<p>Such use of marks utterly prevents a differentiation
between commas and parentheses; and this disregard
of sense relations finds an exact parallel in a disregard,
only too common among careless writers, of
such fundamental differences in meanings as exists
between the words <i>vocation</i> and <i>avocation</i>.</p>

<p>Let us also note that groups of words defined in
Chapter III as “slightly parenthetical” do not make
any break in the thread of thought, so that Sentence
67 is not at all similar to such sentences as were con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>sidered
in that connection. In further proof of this
statement, let us compare Sentence 67 with Sentence
10-2. If the <i>and</i> relation in No. 67 does not exist
between the two groups of words (all that precedes it,
and what follows it up to “is”), the group “I have no
doubt” should be set off by commas, as is a similar
group in Sentence 10-2. This punctuation would
make “and” connect “be” and “it is,” which would
not make sense.</p>

<p>If it is not now clear that the punctuation of Nos.
67 and 67-1 violates the fundamental principles of
the meanings of both marks and sense relations, it
may be worth while to consider the subject further.</p>

<p>Mr. Teall does not go quite so far as Mr. Garrison,
who puts the three marks into a class from which any
one may be selected for the punctuation of Sentence
67. Mr. Teall, however, makes the following statement
(page 50): “As in some instances there is no
absolute choice between commas and parentheses, so
also there is none between parentheses and dashes.”
He illustrates the latter part of his statement, but not
the former. His illustrative example is a sentence
taken from Mr. Wilson’s work, which sentence, he
says, may take either the parentheses or the dashes.
We give the sentence (No. 68) as punctuated by Mr.
Wilson:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>68. If we exercise right principles (and we can not
have them unless we exercise them), they must be perpetually
on the increase.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Teall evidently agrees with Mr. Wilson in
the punctuation of the sentence, which, he says, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
as well take dashes; but he expresses no choice between
the two modes of punctuation.</p>

<p>We have already said that this punctuation violates
fundamental principles; and that it does so is
evidenced by Mr. Wilson’s definitions. In one place
(page 168) he defines a parenthesis as “words thrown
obliquely into the body of a sentence”; and on the
preceding page he says a parenthesis is “an expression
inserted in the body of a sentence,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> with which it has
no connection in sense or in construction.” Mr.
Teall gives a like definition of a parenthesis.</p>

<p>The meaning of “obliquely thrown into” is, we
think, unmistakable. It is equivalent to “thrust
into,” and characterizes matter that is “without
grammatical connection.”</p>

<p>It does not seem to us true that the parenthesis
(group of words) in No. 68 has “no connection in
sense” with the sentence. As “and” gives it constructive
connection, why does “and” not give it
sense relation? and why is “and” used, what does it
mean, and what does it connect?</p>

<p>The punctuation of No. 67-2 seems to us to be
in accord with the fundamental meanings that determine
the use of marks; and it at once differentiates
the dash from the two other marks. These principles
are violated in the punctuation of No. 68,
which requires dashes.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">COMMAS AND PARENTHESES</h3>

<p>The differentiation of the comma, or commas,
from parentheses, is the differentiation of the <i>purely</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>parenthetical from the <i>slightly</i> parenthetical. The
purely parenthetical word or expression is wholly
detached from the essential meaning of the language
in which it is found, and properly takes marks of
parenthesis as evidence of this fact; the slightly parenthetical
is in grammatical relation with some word or
words in the language in which it appears.</p>

<p>An excellent illustration of such erroneous definitions
of a parenthesis as is noted above, and of a lack of
differentiation between the semicolon and the period,
is found in the following sentence, which is the opening
sentence of the preface to a work on the proper
use of words, written, we believe, by one who was
formerly a college professor of English:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>69. The author’s main purpose in this book is to
teach precision in writing; and of good writing (which,
essentially, is clear thinking made visible) precision is
the point of capital concern.</p></blockquote>

<p>From our point of view the principal faults of
this sentence are the following:</p>

<p>1. The <i>and</i> relation between the two clauses “and”
here connects, is a strained one. The real relation
between them would be better expressed by a period
without the conjunction.</p>

<p>2. The <i>explanatory</i> group of words set off by
parentheses is not a <i>parenthesis</i>, and therefore should
not be enclosed in marks of parenthesis. Commas
are the proper marks.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">DASHES AND PARENTHESES</h3>

<p>The indiscriminate substitution of dashes and
parentheses for commas, which is quite common in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
some literary periodicals and in some books by authors
of recognized literary ability, greatly weakens the
value of marks; for there can be no differentiation
between the marks so used, and, consequently, the
first part of either mark fails to give to the reader notice
of what is to follow. The value of the punctuation
is thus weakened. In some sentences, such use of
these marks is not objectionable; but the necessity
of the substitution is not always apparent.</p>

<p>The occasional substitution of parentheses for
commas, where the use of semicolons is thus avoided,
is desirable; but the occasion for such use is rare.
In the following sentence the use of commas is strictly
correct, but the result is not pleasing:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>70. The following were appointed a committee on
organization: John Smith, chairman, Henry Jones, and
William Brown.</p></blockquote>

<p>This punctuation seems to throw the four nouns
following the colon into a series. This effect can be
avoided by the use of a semicolon after “chairman”;
but this punctuation would require another semicolon
after “Jones,” thus grouping the words as words
are grouped in Sentences 7, 7-1, and 7-2. The
better punctuation of sentences like this is to enclose
the descriptive word in parentheses, and retain the
commas for the other words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>70-1. The following were appointed a committee on
organization: John Smith (chairman), Henry Jones, and
William Brown.</p></blockquote>

<p>It seems surprising that good writers will adopt
the punctuation of No. 70, and use it when it tends
to obscure the sense. As illustrative of this point,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
we give a sentence from the current issue of the
<i>Literary Digest</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>71. This new magnet is used for the study of light,
the motions of electrons, the smallest components of
matter, and the minute movements in the interior of an
atom.</p></blockquote>

<p>For the sake of clearness, which is a chief object
of punctuation, the sense relations of the things
named in this sentence as objects of study should be
shown by the punctuation. As “electrons” are “the
smallest components of matter,” the punctuation
should reveal the fact:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>71-1. This new magnet is used for the study of
light, the motions of electrons (the smallest components
of matter), and the minute movements in the interior
of an atom.</p></blockquote>

<p>By reserving dashes for the large groups of words
which are purely parenthetical in nature, but are tied
to what precedes by a connective, generally a conjunction
or a preposition, we do not violate the fundamental
meaning of either the dash or the marks of
parenthesis; and therefore when we meet either mark
its meaning is unmistakable. In short, we do not
make a mark serve an additional and unnecessary
use, and so render it more difficult to interpret as a
sign-board.</p>

<p>When we speak of the “fundamental” meaning
of a mark, we refer to the meaning implied in its name,
the name, of course, being descriptive of a feature of
the language which is to be pointed out by the mark.
The word <i>dash</i>, as has already been said, points out
that the writer has <i>dashed</i> aside, as it were, in his line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
of thought, and is going to “parenthesize” something,
keeping his thought, however, <i>grammatically</i> connected
with what precedes. We violate this principle
in the use of the single dash exemplified in Sentence
33, just as we violate a fundamental principle
in the use of the parentheses in No. 70-1. We
think there is no objection to the former use of the
dash; for it serves a good purpose, and its meaning
can hardly be mistaken. The relation indicated by
the comma and dash is suggested before the mark
is reached, as, in Sentence 33, details are suggested by
the words “three original parties.”</p>

<p>The indiscriminate use of dashes and parentheses
for commas has become quite common; but, after a
very careful study of language thus punctuated, we
can find no justification or excuse for such usage. It
may give the writer a choice of marks, but it gives no
light to the reader. It is too much like using either
red or yellow for a danger-signal when red better
answers the purpose.</p>

<p>Although the differentiation between commas and
parentheses is at times somewhat difficult, generally
it is very easy. The following sentences will illustrate
common uses of the marks where the shades of
meaning are nice, but unmistakable:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>72. Ian Maclaren (Dr. John Watson) wrote “Beside
the Bonnie Briar Bush.”</p>

<p>73. Ian Maclaren, a noted Scotch minister (Dr. John
Watson), is the author of “Beside the Bonnie Briar Bush.”</p>

<p>74. Ian Maclaren (the pen-name of Dr. John Watson)
is unmistakably Scotch.</p></blockquote>

<p>In No. 72 “Dr. John Watson” is purely parentheti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>cal
matter, used to give the reader some information
about the <i>name</i> of the man already mentioned. As
we have been talking about the man, the information
about his name is like an aside,—that is, it is purely
parenthetical. This matter may be omitted without
affecting the sense of the language in any manner;
and, as it is purely parenthetical, it properly takes the
marks of parenthesis.</p>

<p>In No. 73 we have both an explanatory group of
words and a parenthesis. The first is equivalent to
“who is a noted Scotch minister.” In either form it is
an essential part of the information the writer wishes
to convey. We have already defined such a group
as <i>slightly parenthetical</i>, to be set off by commas.</p>

<p>No. 74 is a particularly distractive sentence,
although its punctuation may be technically correct.
The first picture given in this sentence to the reader
is that of a man; the next one, given by the parenthesis,
is that of a name. A third thought follows;
and this thought is applicable to either a <i>man</i> or a
<i>name</i>. As “Watson” is an Irish name, the question
may arise in reading No. 74 whether the writer
wishes to say “Ian Maclaren,” the <i>man</i>, is Scotch, or
“Ian Maclaren,” the <i>name</i>, is Scotch.</p>

<p>There is a conventional way of writing a name of
this kind to show that the name is referred to merely
as a word. This is done by the use of italics or
quotation-marks; and therefore to avoid the distractive
effect of No. 74, it may be written thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>74-1. <i>Ian Maclaren</i> (the pen-name of Dr. John
Watson) is unmistakably Scotch.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here the italics notify the reader that he is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
consider the name, not the person named; and this
name is a Scotch word.</p>

<p>Like notice would be given by the use of quotation-marks
in place of the italics.</p>

<p>The distractive effect caused by producing two
impressions through a wrong use of marks of parenthesis,
should be avoided.</p>

<p class="center" style="page-break-before: always;">EXAMPLES</p>

<p>1. I am a lady, and a coward.</p>

<p>2. I am a lady and—a coward.</p>

<p class="small">In No. 1 the comma makes “a coward” an afterthought.
In No. 2 the dash shows a hesitancy on the part of the writer
about calling herself, or one (a lady) of her sex, a coward. The
shade of meaning between the two sentences is clearly marked.</p>

<p>3. On these occasions I have been grateful to
the happy accident, or design, that made me a participant

the happy accident—or design?—that made me a
participant in such scenes.</p>

<p class="small">In No. 3 the commas indicate an afterthought; in No. 4 the
writer makes an aside, as if asking someone a question, thus
requiring a dash to show the change in thought.</p>

<p>5. The Syracuse (New York) <i>Journal</i> asserts
that the spoilsman must go.</p>

<p>6. The following sentence contains three nouns:
Do (1) good by (2) stealth, and blush to find it (3)
fame.</p>

natural instinct running at large,—a very natural
thing.</p>

<p class="small">In No. 8 the second group is a mere appositive or definition
of the first; but the third group is a restatement of the thought
implied in the two preceding groups. The comma shows the
relation; the dash does the grouping.</p>

<p>9. The examination embraces spelling, punctuation,
the use of capital letters, grammar, arithmetic,
geography (descriptive and physical), languages, etc.</p>

<p>10. If you will take my advice, you will throw
that letter into the fire. (A bright one was blazing on
the hearth.) If you keep it, it will probably tempt
you into an outlay beyond your means.</p>

<p>11. His voice and manner,—the manner of the
old Oxford scholar of the best type, and, alas! of a
bygone generation, with its indescribable indication
of cultured and lettered ease,—were singularly
attractive.</p>

<p>12. Measure as we may the progress of the
world,—materially, in the advantages of steam,
electricity, and other mechanical appliances; sociologically,
in the great improvements in the conditions
of life; intellectually, in the diffusion of education;
morally, in a possibly higher standard of ethics,—there
is no one measure which can compare with the
decrease of physical suffering in man, woman, and
child when stricken by disease or accident.</p>

<p class="small">The consideration of the use of the dash in No. 12 does not
strictly fall in this chapter; and yet its position gives what follows
it the appearance of an aside with grammatical connection
(apposition) with what precedes. “As we may” is equivalent to
“in any manner”; and the matter set off by dashes gives details
of “in any manner,” or, more strictly, of “measure in any
manner.”</p>

<p class="small">Let us here note, parenthetically, that if “as we may” were
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>changed to “as we can,” these words would be set off by commas,
being simply an explanatory group, and not a restrictive group,
as they are now, being equivalent to “in whatever way.”</p>

<p>13. Shooting stars are only little masses of matter,—bits
of rock or metal, or cloudlets of dust and
gas,—which are flying unresisted through space, just
as planets and comets do, in paths which, within the
limits of our solar system, are controlled by the
attraction of the sun.</p>

<p class="small">Why not use marks of parentheses in No. 13, instead of
dashes? The reason lies in the meaning of the former marks.
If “matter” or “little masses of matter” were an obscure term
requiring explanation, the explanatory term would properly take
the form of a parenthesis; but we have here a mere apposition,
used by way of example or illustration, as we might use the
words apples and pears to explain what we mean by the word
fruit in a sentence.</p>

<p>14. That child of so many prayers, who was to
bear the significant name of John (Jehochanan, “the
Lord is gracious”) was to be the source of joy and
gladness to a far wider circle than that of the family.</p>

<p>15. Such scanty record was kept of Sebastian
Cabot’s voyages of 1497 and 1498 that we cannot tell
what land the Cabots first saw,—whether it was the

far South as Cape Breton.</p>

<p>15-1. Such scanty record was kept of Sebastian
Cabot’s voyages of 1497 and 1498 that we cannot
tell what land the Cabots first saw; whether it was
the bleak coast of Northern Labrador, or some point
as far South as Cape Breton, is still a matter of
dispute.</p>

<p class="small">The differentiation between the comma in No. 15 (here
aided by a dash) and the semicolon in No. 15-1, is very plain;
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>and each mark, when reached, unmistakably notifies the reader
what relation exists between what precedes and what follows it.</p>

<p>When one is reading these sentences aloud, each mark
determines the voice-inflection that will convey the meaning to
the listener.</p>

<p>16. An ellipsis or omission of words is found in
all kinds of composition. (Remarks <i>d</i> and <i>i</i>.)</p>

<p>17. When a quotation is short, and closely connected
with the words preceding it, a comma between

<p>18. Capitalize the exclamations “O” and “Oh”
(see chap. iii, sec. 6).</p>

<p>19. In resolutions, italicize the word “<i>Resolved</i>,”
but not the word “Whereas.” (See chap. iv, sec. 36.)</p>

<p class="small">The above four examples show a variety of treatment of
reference matter (real or apparent) that is perplexing, not only
because of the sources of the examples, but because the same
is found many times in the books from which the examples
are taken. Nos. 16 and 17 are from Mr. Wilson’s work, and
Nos. 18 and 19 are from “A Manual for Writers.”</p>

<p class="small">No. 16 is one of a number of examples to be punctuated
according to a preceding rule and the “Remarks” under such
rule. (The punctuation of No. 16 is to follow “Remarks <i>d</i> and
<i>i</i>,” which require commas before and after “or omission.”) Thus
“Remarks <i>d</i> and <i>i</i>” above is purely parenthetical matter in its
relation to the language of the example. As it explains no word
or group of words within the example it is treated as an independent
sentence, and is therefore properly punctuated.</p>

<p class="small">No. 17 is a “Remark” under a general rule. “See page
108” is a part of this “Remark.” Instead of condensing the
information found on page 108 and adding it to what precedes,
in the example such information, additional to and not explanatory
of what precedes it, takes the form of a sentence,—“See
page 108.” It has no reference by way of explanation to what
precedes, but stands for an additional sentence. It also belongs
in another paragraph; and this fact is shown by the dash, the
use of which here is purely conventional punctuation.</p>

<p class="small">We do not understand why the references in Nos. 18 and
19 should not be treated alike. We think No. 19 is correct,
except that “Resolved” should not here be italicized. It is
properly italicized in a resolution, while “Whereas” in a resolution
should be written with a capital and small-capital letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—We do not think that “oh” is often written with a
capital, except when it begins a sentence.</p>

<p>20. None of the ills from which England is at
present suffering are due to democracy or to freedom,
but to inherited conditions and traditions which
British democracy (one of the finest and most devoted
bodies of men and women in the world) has been
working manfully to throw off. These go back to
the days—not yet wholly past—of British Imperialism
and paternalism.</p>

<p class="small">The above example is a good illustration of the improper
use of both the dash and the marks of parenthesis. The group
of words enclosed in parenthesis is an appositive of “British
democracy,” appositional in form and adjectival in meaning.
The group of words set off by dashes is adjectival in both form
and meaning. Each group is explanatory, not restrictive; and
therefore, according to the principles we have discussed herein,
each should be set off by commas.</p>

MISCELLANEOUS USES OF MARKS</h2>

<h3>ADJECTIVES BEFORE A NOUN</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> two or more adjectives come before a noun,
and are not connected by a conjunction, the meaning
to be conveyed determines the punctuation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>75. This is a large wild grape.</p>

<p>75-1. This is a large, wild grape.</p></blockquote>

<p>The punctuation is correct in each of the above
sentences; but the two sentences do not mean the
same.</p>

<p>Sentence No. 75 says that the grape is a large one
in the class of <i>wild grapes</i>, confining the comparison
to wild grapes.</p>

<p>Sentence No. 75-1 says that the grape is large and
is wild. It is large in comparison with all kinds of
grapes.</p>

<p>In No. 75 we give the language its natural meaning.
In No. 75-1 we use a comma to show that the
natural meaning is not the meaning we wish to convey;
we disconnect “large” from “wild grape,” as,
in Sentence 1-1, we disconnected words standing in an
<i>apparent</i> relation which was not the <i>real</i> relation.</p>

<p>Other examples at the end of this chapter will
further illustrate the punctuation.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">DOUBLE OBJECT</h3>

<p>We have already seen that nouns standing together
require some mark between them if their ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>parent
relation is not their real relation. This principle
was illustrated especially in Sentence 8-1.</p>

<p>The so-called double object furnishes an apparent
exception to the principle. The relation, however,
between such words is as regular as the relation between
an adjective and a noun when the former
precedes the latter. Thus the following sentence requires
no mark between the nouns constituting a so-called
double object:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>76. They elected John Smith president.</p></blockquote>

<p>A similar relation is seen when the first noun in
a sentence like the above is followed by an adjective.
The relation is regular, and calls for no mark:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>76-1. They called John Smith wise.</p></blockquote>

<p>In some cases the relation may be more idiomatic
than regular, the mark being omitted because
there is no real need for its use. The next sentence
exhibits such relationship:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>77. I myself will undertake the work.</p></blockquote>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">A “LONG” SUBJECT</h3>

<p>When a subject is composed of two or more words,
and these words do not readily group themselves, a
comma may be helpful to group them as a subject.
This failure of words to fall readily into a group is
generally due to one of three causes: the subject may
be somewhat long and contain marks of punctuation,
or it may end with a word that seems itself to sustain
grammatical and sense relation with the word or
words following it, or it may end with a verb. In
either of such cases the comma serves to show the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
of the subject; and its use is therefore helpful punctuation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>78. Whatever is, is right.</p>

<p>79. He that sees a building as a common spectator,
contents himself with speaking of it in the most general
terms.</p></blockquote>

<p>The use of the comma after “spectator” simply
warns the reader that “the spectator contents himself”
is not the meaning of the language at this point.
The comma disconnects “spectator” and “contents,”
just as the comma disconnects certain words in Sentence
1-1. Thus the punctuation of this sentence
depends upon the fundamental principle of <i>grouping</i>
and <i>disjunction</i>.</p>

<p>This principle also explains the value of a comma
at the end of several subject-nouns not connected by
a conjunction:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>80. Ease, indulgence, luxury, sloth, are the sources
of misery.</p></blockquote>

<p>With the conjunction “and” before “sloth,” the
comma after “sloth” would not be needed, as “and”
and the comma before it would give notice of the ending
of the group.</p>

<p>The value of a comma in No. 79 is unmistakable;
but is such punctuation helpful when the subject
clearly ends itself, either because of its manifest completeness
or because there is no apparent relation between
the last word of the subject and the predicate
verb? Probably a definite and satisfactory answer
to this question cannot be given, for the mental capacity
and alertness of the reader are involved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">DOUBTFUL MODIFIERS</h3>

<p>Perhaps more obscurity in language, often resulting
in hurtful misunderstandings and expensive litigation,
grows out of doubtful modifiers than out of
any other source of bad construction. A knowledge
of punctuation here serves a very useful purpose, not
always by putting the proper mark in the proper
place, but generally by showing the writer the necessity
of recasting his sentence, thus removing the cause
of any possible wrong interpretation. Punctuation
points out the danger; the writer removes it.</p>

<p>What did Smith write according to the wording
and punctuation of the following sentence?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>81. Smith wrote part of the preface and Chapter I.</p></blockquote>

<p>It says clearly that Smith wrote <i>part</i> of the preface
and <i>part</i> of Chapter I.</p>

<p>And what does the next sentence say he wrote?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>81-1. Smith wrote part of the preface, and Chapter I.</p></blockquote>

<p>It says that Smith wrote <i>part</i> of the preface, and
<i>all</i> of Chapter I.</p>

<p>It is not wise to make the meaning of language,
especially in important matters, depend upon a mode
of punctuation little understood. The wise way is to
recast the language. Legal phraseology grew out of
the difficulty of so writing as to make one’s meaning
unmistakable; but it went to the extreme in verbiage,
and has become distasteful even to lawyers. Such
verbiage is not necessary to express one’s meaning.</p>

<p class="tb">Our next sentence is particularly informing to us
in our efforts to establish two or three fundamental
principles governing the use of all marks:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>82. Life may be held so pure, so receptive to all high
influence, so noble in its aspirations, as to furnish the right
conditions for these finer promptings; or it may so degenerate
into the material, the selfish, the self-centered,
as to become deaf and blind and unresponsive to them.</p></blockquote>

<p>The comma after “aspirations” is used to disconnect
the two groups of words between which it stands,
thus breaking up an apparent group (so noble in its
aspirations as to furnish the right conditions for these
finer promptings), and forming out of it two groups,
each of which begins with “so,” each group having
for its complement the group beginning with “as.”</p>

<p>We perhaps may not say that the comma after
“aspirations” at once gives notice of the relation of
each of the preceding groups to what follows; but,
when the comma cuts “as” off from the preceding
“so,” it shows that “as” introduces a group completing
each of the preceding groups introduced by “so.”
This disconnection between the last two groups compels
the reader to make the new grouping.</p>

<p>In the second of the larger groups of this sentence
occurs a somewhat similar grouping made by “so—as.”
Here the comma is used, just as it is used in Sentence
80, to mark the end of the first part of the group.
Its use in both clauses may be said to follow the
punctuation diagrammatically exhibited in Sentence
3-2. In No. 82 the reader suspends the thought
partially expressed by “so pure” until he reaches the
complementary group of words beginning with “as.”
This process of suspending the thought occurs in this
clause after each group introduced by “so.” The
process, instead of being difficult, is well-nigh intui<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>tive,
for “so” naturally raises the expectation of the
correlative “as,” which introduces the complement of
each group introduced by “so.”</p>

<p>Let us also note the last grouping in this sentence,
where “to them” is tied to each of the three preceding
adjectives by the grouping <i>ands</i>, thus requiring
no mark after the last adjective.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">INTERMEDIATE RESTRICTIVE GROUPS</h3>

<p>Probably at no other point in punctuation do
writers obscure the meaning of language so much as
in dealing with <i>restrictive</i> and <i>explanatory</i> groups of
words. We dealt with the subject in Chapter III, but
passed over one feature of it,—namely, the intermediate
restrictive group, or a restrictive group coming
between two other groups closely tied together in
sense, and seemingly requiring the suspension of the
intermediate group by commas.</p>

<p>Before dealing with these groups, let us consider
an interesting sentence, from very high authority,
which tends to confirm our statement concerning the
importance of properly punctuating restrictive and
explanatory modifiers. The sentence is from a passage
in Dean Alford’s notable book, “A Plea for the
Queen’s English,” in which passage the Dean severely
scolds compositors for their bad punctuation, particularly
for the insertion of commas “without the
slightest compunction.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>83. I have some satisfaction in reflecting, that, in
the course of editing the Greek text of the New Testament,
I believe I have destroyed more than a thousand commas,
which prevented the text being properly understood.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. De Vinne quotes the passage in which this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
sentence appears; and he does so in apparent approval
of Dean Alford’s condemnation of the misuse of commas.
Mr. De Vinne makes a single comment upon
the passage, in which he says “the last comma in this
extract is superfluous.” The reference is to the comma
before “which.”</p>

<p>The comma before “which” is not simply “superfluous”:
it is wrong. It is <i>wrong</i> because it changes
the meaning of the language by making the writer
say, apparently, that he destroyed <i>all</i> the commas
in the text, while he, unquestionably, intended to
say he destroyed more than a thousand <i>offending</i> commas,
that is, commas <i>that</i> (which) <i>obscured the text</i>.</p>

<p>The superfluous comma in the above sentence is,
in our opinion, the one after “reflecting.” This
comma is used in accordance with the convention of
Dean Alford’s day, and follows a rule of “close”
punctuation.</p>

<p>But the punctuation is very bad at another point;
and, we venture to say, in spite of the great distinction
of its author as an English scholar, the language
at this point is not the “Queen’s English.” Omitting
the intermediate and final groups of words, and the
superfluous comma, the sentence will read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>83-1. I have some satisfaction in reflecting that I
believe I have destroyed more than a thousand commas.</p></blockquote>

<p>“Satisfaction in reflecting <i>that I believe</i>,” is, to say
the least, a curious satisfaction. This is not the meaning
the writer wished to convey.</p>

<p>The obvious error cannot be mended by setting
“I believe” off with commas, for this would simply
throw doubt upon the statement which follows (I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
destroyed), which is a positive statement, needing no
qualification. The only doubtful assertion in the
sentence is as to the <i>number</i> of commas destroyed.
The evident meaning of the language is, that the
number of commas destroyed is <i>probably</i> (I believe)
more than a thousand. To be sure, “probably” and
“I believe” are not exactly equivalent terms; but the
word <i>probably</i> here serves to show how “I believe” is
used. We set it off by commas because of its slightly
parenthetical character.</p>

<p>The entire sentence should be written thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>83-2. I have some satisfaction in reflecting that, in
the course of editing the Greek text of the New Testament,
I have destroyed, I believe, more than a thousand commas
which prevented the text being properly understood.</p></blockquote>

<p>The absence of a comma before the <i>adjective</i> group
of words beginning with “which,” tells the reader
that such adjective group is <i>restrictive</i>, thus confining
the destruction to <i>harmful</i> commas.</p>

<p>Let us turn aside again to ask why, in the sentence
above and beginning with “The evident,”
“probably” takes no commas, while a similar expression
(I believe) in No. 83-2 requires them. “Probably”
here requires no commas because it coalesces
with “more”; while “I believe” does not do so, but
makes a decided break in the smoothness of the sentence.
The latter expression is like an aside, thus becoming
slightly parenthetical. The use of commas
with “probably” would make “probably” more emphatic,
because the pauses thus indicated would call
special attention to it. Such use is good punctuation.</p>

<p>We will now turn to a restrictive group of words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
that comes between two other groups closely connected
in meaning.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson treats this subject at length, but, we
think, in an unsatisfactory way. We find in the
wording of one of his rules an illustration of this mode
of punctuation which seems more informing than his
discussion of the subject. As we do not desire to
consider the subject-matter of Mr. Wilson’s rule, we
make up a sentence modeled upon its language:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>84. When books, that have been thoroughly examined
and unqualifiedly approved by a board of college professors,
are recommended by a teacher, her pupils should not refuse
to read them.</p></blockquote>

<p>The adjective group of words following “books”
is restrictive. It is perhaps made more clearly so by
the use of a pronoun (that) formerly used, in the place
of <i>who</i> or <i>which</i>, to introduce a <i>restrictive</i> adjective in
the form of a pronominal group of words.</p>

<p>If “which” be substituted for “that” in this sentence,
the restrictive character of the group may not
be so readily apparent; but this would not change the
punctuation recommended by Mr. Wilson. Let us
deal with the sentence in this form:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>84-1. When books, which have been thoroughly examined
and unqualifiedly approved by a board of college
professors, are recommended by a teacher, her pupils
should not refuse to read them.</p></blockquote>

<p>If it is deemed helpful punctuation to set off by
commas the group of words between “books” and
“are,” in order to show clearly the dependence of
“books” upon “are recommended,” then commas
are required. If, on the other hand, we wish to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
by the punctuation that the group of words following
“books” is restrictive, we must omit the comma after
“books.” Thus, apparently, we must here make a
choice between two modes of punctuation. As failure
to distinguish by punctuation the character of a
qualifier,—that is, whether restrictive or explanatory,—not
infrequently totally obscures the sense, we
do not quite like a rule that calls for a comma before
a restrictive group of words.</p>

<p>The sentence may be written without a comma
after “books,” but with one after “professors.”
The use of the latter would follow the punctuation of
No. 79. This mode of punctuation is, after all, only
a choice between two modes of punctuation. The
better way is to recast all such sentences. No. 84
may be recast in several ways; but it is difficult, without
introducing a new word, clearly to express the
fact that <i>one kind</i> of books is meant, as shown in the
restrictive adjective in both Nos. 84 and 84-1.</p>

<p>We suggest the following form for the recast sentence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>84-2. When <i>certain</i> books have been thoroughly examined
and unqualifiedly approved by a board of college
professors, and have been recommended by a teacher, her
pupils should not refuse to read them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Every restrictive word or group of words confines
the meaning of the word or words so modified to a
<i>certain</i> thing or <i>certain</i> things. The man <i>who was
here yesterday</i> means a <i>certain</i> man, and means so because
of the restrictive group of words following
“man”; but “the man, <i>who was here yesterday</i>,” is
not so designated by the same group of words set off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
by commas. These points were considered in another
place in this book.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">NOT—BUT</h3>

<p>The punctuation of intermediate groups of words
gives rise to a peculiar phraseology, which needs explanation.
We have seen that the intermediate group
is set off by commas to show that the sense is suspended
at the point where the first comma is placed, to be
continued by connection with what follows the
complementary comma. We illustrated this process
diagrammatically in Sentence 4-3 by actually suspending
on the printed page the intermediate group.</p>

<p>We do not hesitate to use commas in the following
sentence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>85. His success was attained, not by ability and
enterprise, but by friendly assistance.</p></blockquote>

<p>If we suspend or omit the intermediate group in
the above we obtain a result which is not a good sentence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>85-1. His success was attained but by friendly assistance.</p></blockquote>

<p>We can say of such language as that of No. 85
only that it is <i>idiomatic</i>, thus justifying it as we
justify the grammatical solecism “<i>than whom</i>.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson makes an exception to this mode of
punctuation that is very perplexing; and it is probably
because of this that few, if any, other writers refer to
or deal with it.</p>

<p>We shall not attempt to discuss Mr. Wilson’s rule,
but let us consider one of his examples:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>86. It <i>is not</i> from wild beasts, but from untamed
passions, that the greatest evils arise to human society.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<p>We think the omission of a comma after “is,”
thus suspending the negative group beginning with
“not,” is justified, if at all, by the fact that such a
sentence is usually read without a pause after the
verb; in other words, the language thus readily groups
itself, and shows the meaning and the force of the
negative intermediate group.</p>

<p>Not a few good writers use a comma before “not”
in sentences like No. 86.</p>

<p>If one or more words intervene between the verb
and the negative particle, the parts of the sentence
do not coalesce, and the comma is required.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>87. He came not to teach, but to be taught.</p>

<p>87-1. He came here, not to teach, but to be taught.</p></blockquote>

<p>If we change the form of No. 87, we may perhaps
see somewhat more clearly why this grouping is more
natural than would be a grouping made by a comma
after the verb (came):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>87-2. He did not come to teach, but to be taught.</p></blockquote>

<p>No. 87-2 seems to show that the grouping made
by the comma in No. 87 is a natural grouping.</p>

<p>In spite of Mr. Wilson’s rule, and of our reasoning
to explain it, we believe that each mode of punctuating
the following sentence is correct, each depending
upon where the emphasis is to be laid:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>88. The book’s primary aim is, not to convince the
skeptic, but to solve the difficulties of the best-thinking
men.</p>

<p>88-1. The book’s primary aim is not to convince the
skeptic, but to solve the difficulties of the best-thinking
men.</p></blockquote>

<p>In No. 88 the emphasis is placed upon “to solve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
the difficulties,” the preceding group being thrown in
for contrast, thus heightening the effect of the statement
made in the next group of words.</p>

<p>In No. 88-1 the emphasis falls upon “not to convince
the skeptic,” just as it would if written, “It is
not the book’s aim to convince the skeptic.”</p>

<p>Let us note carefully that the mode of punctuation
in each of the two preceding sentences would
grow out of the context, which would clearly tell where
the emphasis was to be laid.</p>

<p>We have dwelt upon this punctuation in order to
emphasize a purpose of punctuation too often overlooked.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">O and OH</h3>

<p>The Century Dictionary says there is no difference
between <i>O</i> and <i>oh</i> except that of their present spelling.
The New Standard and Webster’s New International
do not go so far, but they point out the difference
observed by most good writers.</p>

<p><i>O</i> is generally used only in direct address; and, as
the name of the person or thing addressed immediately
follows it, it takes no mark of punctuation
after it. An exclamation-point may follow the group
of words introduced by <i>O</i>. Its vocative character
is not lost when the person or thing addressed is not
named, for it may be understood.</p>

<p><i>O</i> is used more in poetry than in prose.</p>

<p><i>O</i> is used in an ejaculatory expression when followed
by <i>for</i> or <i>that</i>. It does not here seem to lose its
vocative character, although the name of the thing
or person addressed may not readily be supplied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<p><i>O</i> is sometimes used colloquially in expressions
like “O my!” “O dear!” etc.</p>

<p><i>Oh</i> is purely ejaculatory, and takes a comma or an
exclamation-point immediately after it; but the latter
mark may follow the group of words beginning with
<i>oh</i>, with a comma before <i>oh</i>.</p>

<p><i>O</i> is always written with a capital, but <i>oh</i> takes
a capital only when beginning a sentence. Some
writers prefer always to write <i>oh</i> with a capital.</p>

CONVENTIONAL USES OF MARKS</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> uses of marks seem to be based solely upon
convention, or arbitrary custom. Back of this convention
there may be, in many cases, reason for the
punctuation; but, more frequently, there seems to be
no reason.</p>

<p>It is not always worth while carefully to attempt
to distinguish between reason and convention; but it
is quite important to know what is the best, or, at
least, what is good, conventional usage, and to follow it
in one’s writing. We think it reasonable to call <i>good</i>
only such conventional punctuation as is found in the
work of writers, and of expert editors of copy, who
use marks with a fair degree of consistency, and do
not often violate the fundamental principles of punctuation
already discussed herein. The punctuation
found in most weekly and monthly periodicals is very
poor, and is often inferior to that of daily newspapers.
In a very few magazines (it would be difficult to name
a half dozen, either American or European), and in a
considerable number of daily newspapers, the use of
marks is discriminating and helpful; in most of our
periodical literature the use of marks is so distractive
as to make the presence of any mark other than the
end-marks of doubtful value, at least to readers not
familiar with the meanings of most of the marks of
punctuation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">THE PERIOD</h3>

<p>1. A period or any other mark, except an interrogation-point,
is not often used after a display line
in the title-page of a book. This practice is well-nigh
universal in book-work, and almost equally so in
magazines.</p>

<p>2. A period is generally placed after the letter or
the number indicating a division in enumerations.
Periods are so used after the figures 1 and 2 numbering
this and the preceding paragraph.</p>

<p>If the divisions have subdivisions, and the subdivisions
are further subdivided, it is helpful to the
reader if a good conventional style is followed. In
case of four divisions and subdivisions, a good conventional
style is as follows:</p>

<p>The capital letters (A, B, C, etc.) mark the main
divisions of the subject.</p>

<p>The Roman capital numerals (I, II, III, IV, etc.)
mark the subdivision of A, B, C, etc.</p>

<p>The Arabic figures (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) mark the subdivision
of I, II, III, etc.</p>

<p>The small or lower-case letters (a, b, c, etc.) mark
the subdivision of 1, 2, 3, etc. The italic letters are
generally used.</p>

<p>If there is only a single enumeration, the Arabic
figures (1, 2, 3, etc.) are used.</p>

<p>If there are one enumeration and one subdivision,
the Arabic figures and the lower-case letters are used.</p>

<p>If one or more of the first divisions are subdivided,
and one or more of such subdivisions are subdivided,
the Roman numerals, the Arabic figures, and the lower-case
letters are used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>The enumerating letters (A, B, etc.) of the first, or
main, divisions are indented the space of the usual
paragraph; the subdivisions of the first divisions are
so far indented that their enumerating letters or
figures are in alignment with the first letter of the
first word under the division above. This mode of
indention is continued with the next subdivisions,
thus putting the enumerating letters or figures of the
respective divisions or subdivisions in perpendicular
alignment. This mode of enumeration and indention
can be illustrated diagrammatically:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>89.</p>

<p class="indent padl15">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital letters (A, B, C, etc.) will mark the
main divisions of the subject.</p>

<p class="indent padl4"><b>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Roman numerals (I, II, III, etc.) will
mark the subdivisions of A, B, C, etc.</b></p>

<p class="indent padl6">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arabic figures (1, 2, 3, etc.) will mark
the subdivisions of I, II, III, etc.</p>

<p class="indent padl8"><i>a.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;The italic lower-case letters (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>,
etc.) will mark the subdivisions of 1,
2, 3, etc.</p>

<p>B. Here follows the second main division, its enumerating
letter (B) being in perpendicular alignment
with “A,” above.</p></blockquote>

<p>This mode of indention and alignment is not observed
unless the divisions and subdivisions are
somewhat close together; for, otherwise, the alignment
of the enumerating letters or figures would not
be apparent to the eye. It is particularly useful
in the preparation of a syllabus.</p>

<p class="tb">An extra indention of the second and following
lines of each subdivision helps to make clear the
alignment of the enumerating letters and figures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
This is particularly desirable in type-written manuscript.
In book-work the lines are often too short to
permit so great indention, and therefore the letters
and figures are indented the usual paragraph space.</p>

<p>A half-parenthesis is sometimes used with <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>,
etc., as the half-bracket is used in dramatic composition.
This is the German style. We do not know
what is gained by it, unless it is used for an additional
subdivision.</p>

<p>Some punctuators enclose in parentheses figures
and lower-case letters when used before paragraph-enumerations.
Generally, such usage is condemned
by the meanings of the marks, and serves no useful
purpose. Marks of parenthesis are properly used to
enclose figures and letters enumerating particulars
within the limits of a sentence or a paragraph. If
one or more of the particulars are composed of two
or more sentences, each of the particulars should be
put in paragraph form, in order clearly to group the
parts of each particular.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—It is hardly proper to designate as a paragraph that
which is a part of a sentence; and we therefore use the term
“paragraph form” to designate a group of words that is a part of
a sentence, and is yet put in the form of a paragraph, and is
numbered as a particular.</p>

<p>As a rule, each enumerating group in paragraph
form is composed of one or more sentences; and thus
each enumerating figure or letter becomes a part of
a paragraph group, and therefore loses its parenthetical
nature. If each paragraph group is composed of a
single group of words constituting only a phrase or a
sentence, it may be followed conventionally by a
semicolon, and thus give apparent justification for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
use of parentheses enclosing the enumerating figures
or letters. The following example will illustrate the
point:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>90. There are three objections to buying very cheap
editions of standard uncopyrighted books:</p>

<p>(1) The text is almost always inaccurate;</p>

<p>(2) The punctuation is so poor that, often, the meaning
of the language is entirely changed;</p>

<p>(3) The printing is generally so poor as to injure the
eyes of the reader.</p></blockquote>

<p>To divide paragraph groups by semicolons is so obviously
inconsistent that little justification can be
found for this form of writing. If it is desirable, for
the sake of the ease of reading thereby gained, to
paragraph the particulars, as in the above sentence,
the parentheses and semicolons should not be used:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>90-1. There are three objections to buying very cheap
editions of standard uncopyrighted books:</p>

<p>1. The text is almost always inaccurate.</p>

<p>2. The punctuation is so poor that, often, the meaning
of the language is entirely changed.</p>

<p>3. The printing is generally so poor as to injure the
eyes of the reader.</p></blockquote>

<p>The De Vinne Press does not use a period after
the letters and figures noting paragraph enumerations.
This is not very common usage; but it is followed
in the Bible and in practically all hymn-books,
no period following the verse-numbers. As it makes
a better-looking page, the style should be adopted.
It is not adopted herein, except on pages xi and xii, for
we prefer not to follow a limited conventional usage.</p>

<p>3. A period and a dash are generally used after
a side-head. The dash sets the group of words off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
from what follows, and thus shows at a glance that
the words are a heading, and not a part of the sentence
following. This style is very common, and is helpful
to the reader. Side-heads are generally put in italics,
but often in small capitals or bold-face type.</p>

<p>The same marks are put after the word “Note”
(the word is generally printed with a capital and small
capitals) when used to introduce remarks (a note) in
the text.</p>

<p>4. The period and dash are used before the name
of the author or the title of the work following a quotation
when the name of the author or the work begins
on the last line. If such name is dropped below
the last line of type, the dash alone is used before the
name.</p>

<p>5. The period is used to indicate abbreviations.
(See Chapter XIII.)</p>

<p>6. The period is used by some printing-offices,
notably The Riverside Press, between the figures expressing
the time of day:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>91. The train arrives at 6.20 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>As this makes the “20” look like a decimal, the
style is not to be commended.</p>

<p>7. The period is used to indicate decimals.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Quite contrary to the statement made in not a few
school text-books, a cipher standing alone frequently precedes
the decimal point, and is useful when it will prevent an error
that is especially to be guarded against,—for example, in a physician’s
prescription. It is easy to read “.1 gm.” as <i>one</i> gram; but
“0.1 gm.” is quite unmistakable, even with a faint mark for the
decimal sign (period), because the spacing between the figures
serves to show that a period belongs there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">THE COLON</h3>

<p>The conventional uses of the colon are not numerous.
The following are the principal ones:</p>

<p>1. Between figures expressing the time of day in
hours and minutes; but, as stated above, the period
is used by some good printing-houses:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>92. The train arrives at 6:20 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>2. Between the name of a publisher and the place
of publication, especially in title-pages and in book
titles:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>93. New York: The Macmillan Company.</p></blockquote>

<p>3. After the salutatory phrase at the beginning
of a letter, if not on the first line of the letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>94. Dear Sir:</p>

<p>Your letter of the 21st ultimo is at hand.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the salutatory phrase is put on the first line
of the text of the letter, a comma and a dash is the
usual punctuation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>94-1. Dear Mr. Smith,—Your letter of the 25th ultimo
is at hand.</p></blockquote>

<p>4. After the salutatory phrase used by a speaker
in addressing the chairman or the audience.</p>

<p>5. Many good punctuators use a dash with a
colon when the colon is at the end of a paragraph.
As the salutatory phrase in No. 94 is a paragraph, a
dash would follow the colon. This is the style of
The Riverside Press. We followed it in the first
edition of this work. The combination is not pleasing
to the eye, and therefore we do not now use the two
marks together.</p>

<p>6. It cannot be denied that the use of the colon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
after different forms of the verb “to be,” and preceding
details, is good <i>conventional</i> punctuation. We
think it exceedingly bad punctuation; for it separates
words (the verb and its predicate) that are in
the closest grammatical relation, and, generally, the
mark is without apparent purpose.</p>

<p>Our illustrative sentence is from the work of Mr.
Teall, who explains that the colon is used because of
the modifiers following the name of the persons:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>95. Among those present were: John Brown, who
made a speech; Adam Smith, with his wife and daughter;
Charles Jones, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>We think no mark is needed after “were.” As
indicated elsewhere, if the particulars are put into
paragraph form, thus leaving “were” at the end of
an incomplete line, a dash may be used, simply to act
as a sort of leader for the eye, or as a partial filler of
the blank space in the line:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>95-1. Among those present were—John
Brown, who made a speech....</p></blockquote>

<p>Some good punctuators would use no mark after
“were” in No. 95-1.</p>

<p>In No. 95 we give Mr. Teall’s punctuation, which
shows a comma before “etc.” This makes “etc.”
stand for a modifier of “Jones”; and this, in turn,
puts three words, with their modifiers, in a series
without a conjunction before the last one. Such
grouping is not in the usual form of grouping, except
in language where, as we believe, the proper relations
are overlooked, as they seem to be here.</p>

<p>This apparently doubtful meaning of the comma,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>—
that is, whether it indicates that “etc.” stands for a
modifier, like the preceding ones, or for additional
persons,—may be avoided by using “and” after the
second semicolon, thus making “etc.” stand for a
modifier of Jones, or by the use of a semicolon after
“Jones,” thus making “etc.” stand for an additional
group or groups.</p>

<p>In such sentences as No. 95, Mr. Wilson and other
writers on punctuation suggest the use of a comma
before the beginning of the semicolon-divided group.
This punctuation might be based upon the use of a
comma at the end of a long subject. The use of the
colon is based, of course, on the ground that some
introductory word like <i>namely</i> is understood.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">THE SEMICOLON</h3>

<p>We believe there are only two purely conventional
uses of the semicolon:</p>

<p>1. As stated on a preceding page, a book title
with a subtitle introduced by “or,” takes a semicolon
before “or” and a comma after it:</p>

<p>96. Why We Punctuate; or, Reason versus Rule in
the Use of Marks.</p>

<p>2. Before an example or the specifications of
particulars. We will give Mr. Wilson’s rule for their
use. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>97. A semicolon is put before <i>as</i>, <i>viz.</i>, <i>to wit</i>, <i>namely</i>,
<i>i. e.</i>, or <i>that is</i>, when they precede an example or a
specification of particulars....</p></blockquote>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The punctuation in the above sentence has a striking
peculiarity, which may readily deceive even a very careful
reader. The use of “or” apparently makes <i>one</i> of the particulars
enumerated the antecedent of “they,” thus requiring the singular
pronoun “it,” instead of “they,” in the clause that follows.
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
As Mr. Wilson would neither make nor overlook such a simple
error in grammatical construction, we must look more closely
for a meaning of the language that will justify the use of “they.”
Such meaning is found in the relation between “<i>i. e.</i>” and “<i>that
is</i>.” As “<i>i. e.</i>” (<i>id est</i>) is the Latin abbreviation for “<i>that is</i>,”
the <i>or</i> relation exists between only these particulars in the list.
The comma before “or” follows the punctuation exemplified
in Sentence 17. This meaning of the language ends the
series with “<i>i. e.</i>”; and the relation between the items of the
series is the <i>and</i> relation, which requires the plural pronoun
“they.”</p>

<p class="small">The use of the conjunction “and” after “namely” would
correct the fault; but the meaning of the sentence might not be
easily apprehended by all readers.</p>

<p class="small">These relations can best be revealed by recasting the language.
It may be done thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>97-1. A semicolon is put before <i>as</i>, <i>viz.</i>, <i>to wit</i>, <i>namely</i>,
and <i>i. e.</i>, or its English unabbreviated equivalent, <i>that
is</i>, when they....</p></blockquote>

<p class="small">If we attempt to remedy the fault by putting “<i>that is</i>” in
parentheses after “<i>i. e.</i>,” we take “<i>that is</i>” out of the list of
words enumerated, making it simply an explanation of “<i>i. e.</i>”</p>

<p class="small">A confusion in grouping, and consequently in meaning, due
to the absence of the proper conjunction or the proper mark of
punctuation at the end of a series, is very common.</p>

<p>This use of the semicolon and a comma is without
reason, so far as we can determine; but it is very
firmly fixed conventionally. The objection to it is,
that it makes the semicolon a mark of apposition,
along with the colon, the comma, and the comma and
dash; and its use for such purpose detracts from its
more common use of grouping when the <i>and</i> or <i>or</i> relation
exists, whether expressed or understood, as exemplified
in Sentences 7 and 20-1.</p>

<p>Mr. De Vinne uses a comma before such an introductory
particle, and a colon after it; but he makes no
reference to the established usage, nor does he give
any reason for such punctuation. The reason is
simple: the particle is slightly parenthetical, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
requiring to be set off by commas; but the relation
between what precedes and what follows is clearly the
<i>colon</i> relation. When particulars are formally enumerated,
this relation requires a colon on one side of
the particle; and the colon will supersede one of the
commas. On which side of the particle does the colon
belong?</p>

<p>Although Mr. De Vinne, in his own work, puts the
colon <i>after</i> the particle, the Century Dictionary, which
is issued from the De Vinne Press, puts it <i>before</i> the
particle when introducing illustrative examples. The
position of the colon in either place is easily explained:
if after the particle, the particle is more closely connected
with the general term than with the particulars,
which follow the colon; if before the particle, the particle
is more closely connected with the particulars.</p>

<p>These relations will appear more clearly in examples:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>98. The student failed in three studies, namely:
spelling, grammar, and history.</p>

<p>98-1. The student failed in three studies: namely,
spelling, grammar, and history.</p></blockquote>

<p>If we substitute “by name” for “namely,” the
sense relation between “namely” and “studies,”
in one sentence, and between “namely” and the items
following in the other sentence, is unmistakable. We
can therefore put any such particle where it seems
best to reveal the meaning.</p>

<p>We think “by name” is closely associated with
“studies,” just as the word “named” or “called”
would be, if used in the place of “by name.” This
relation therefore requires the colon after the particle.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">THE INTERROGATION-POINT</h3>

<p>The mark of interrogation has three uses:</p>

<p>1. It is used after a word or group of words asking
a question, whether or not such word or words
indicate by their form that a question is asked. This
usage has already been illustrated. (Page 2.)</p>

<p>2. Enclosed in the proper marks (parentheses, if
in the writer’s own language; brackets, if in quoted
language), it is placed at a point in a sentence to indicate
that the writer questions the accuracy of what
immediately precedes it.</p>

<p>This use of the mark of interrogation is not in
good taste unless it is for a serious, and not a frivolous,
purpose. A foot-note is, in most cases, a better means
of expression:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>99. He said he was born in 1840(?).</p>

<p>100. He was asked for an exact statement of his age.
He replied: “I was born in 1840[?].”</p></blockquote>

<p>3. It is used by an editor in the margin of a
manuscript, or by a proof-reader in the margin of a
proof, to question the accuracy of a statement or the
correctness of the form of language at the point indicated
by the editor or proof-reader. When thus used
it is not necessarily enclosed in other marks.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">THE EXCLAMATION-POINT</h3>

<p>This point is used in two ways:</p>

<p>1. It is used after a word or group of words to
express command, surprise, or emotion.</p>

<p>2. Enclosed in brackets, it is used in a quotation
to express surprise, irony, or contempt.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>101. Wake up! Something is going wrong!</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>102. Oh, how hard my lot[!]</p></blockquote>

<p>The practice of using two or three exclamation-points
together is not now followed.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">ELLIPSIS</h3>

<p>When one, for the sake of brevity or otherwise,
omits a word, a group of words, or one or more sentences
from a quotation, such omission, or <i>ellipsis</i>, is
indicated by either periods or stars. Periods are
generally preferred on the ground that they look
better on the printed page than stars. Unfortunately,
the number of periods used for an ellipsis is not
definitely fixed by convention. Some writers and printers
use three, and others use four; we prefer three.</p>

<p>If words are omitted from the end of a sentence,
the end-mark of the sentence, if an exclamation-point
or an interrogation-point, is retained, and follows
the three periods. If the end-mark of the sentence
is a period, and one or more sentences following
are omitted, there will be four periods at this
point. There will be the same number if words
are omitted from the beginning of a sentence following
a sentence ending with a period.</p>

<p>If stars are used, the closing period is retained.</p>

<p>If one or more paragraphs, or if, in poetry, one
or more lines, are omitted, a full line of periods or
stars is used.</p>

<p>A dash or stars are used in the place of letters
omitted from a word, and the dash in place of figures
omitted from a number of figures. Stars were formerly
much used for omitted letters.</p>

<p>Examples will illustrate the punctuation under con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>sideration.
Our first example is taken from the current
issue of a well-known weekly periodical:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>103. Who commissioned them, a minority, a less than
minority <span class="gesperrt3">...?...</span> Some of them are misguided,
some of them are blind, most of them are ignorant. I
would rather pray for them<span class="gesperrt3">....</span>  They do not tell me
what they are attempting.</p></blockquote>

<p>How shall we interpret the marks indicating the
three ellipses in the above sentence?</p>

<p>The first three periods stand for words omitted
from the end of an interrogative sentence, whose
end-mark follows such periods.</p>

<p>The second group of three periods indicates an
ellipsis of one or more entire sentences. If they
indicated an ellipsis of only a part of the next sentence,
“Some” would not begin with a capital.</p>

<p>The next group of four periods is composed of
three periods for the ellipsis and one period for the
end-mark of the sentence.</p>

<p>It should be noted that ellipses from quotations
are of only such matter as can be omitted without
affecting the sense of the language quoted.</p>

<p>Marks of quotation will include the marks of
ellipsis that begin or end the quoted matter.</p>

<p>The use of stars in the first part of No. 103 will
convey no more definite information than the periods
give the reader; but their use in the second part of the
sentence, accompanied by a period, will at once show
that they stand for the ellipsis of one or more sentences:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>103-1. I would rather pray for them.<span class="gesperrt2"> * * *</span>
They do not tell me what they are attempting.</p></blockquote>

QUOTATION-MARKS</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Quotation-marks</span> are either single or double. The
former consist of one inverted comma and one apostrophe;
the latter, of two inverted commas and two
apostrophes.</p>

<p>The double marks are very generally used in this
country for a single quotation; but some writers and
some printing-offices follow the English style of using
the single marks.</p>

<p>Quotation-marks are used by a writer to identify
as the exact language of another writer a word or
group of words which the first writer uses within his
own language.</p>

<p>They are sometimes used by a writer to enclose a
quotation from his own printed or spoken language.
The fact that such quoted matter is his own language
is practically always shown by the text.</p>

<p>If the quoted language contains a quotation, such
quotation is identified by the quotation-marks (single
or double) not used for the main quotation.</p>

<p>If the subordinate quotation begins the main
quotation, three marks (one double and one single)
are used at the beginning; if the subordinate ends the
main, three marks are also used at the close.</p>

<p>Illustrations of the three uses above defined are
found in the following examples:</p>

<p><small><b>104. In appreciation of Mrs. George Ripley, Mr.
Frothingham says, “Theodore Parker made the following
</b></small><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span><small><b>entry in his journal: ‘Mrs. Ripley gave me a tacit rebuke
for not shrieking at wrongs, and spoke of the danger of
losing our humanity in abstractions.’”</b></small></p>

<p>If a quotation consists of two or more paragraphs
appearing <i>consecutively</i> in the work quoted from,
quotation-marks are used only at the beginning of
each paragraph and at the end of the last one. If two
or more paragraphs are printed consecutively in the
quotation, but do not appear consecutively in the
work quoted from, each paragraph is identified as a
whole by marks at its beginning and end.</p>

<p>If only a part of a sentence or of a paragraph is
quoted, and it is desirable to show this fact, the
omitted part or parts are indicated by periods or
stars. If such marks of omission come at the beginning
or at the end of the quoted matter, the marks
of quotation are so placed as to include them.</p>

<p>If the quoted matter is a letter or document with
place-and date-lines preceding it, and with a complimentary
closing-line and one or more signatures following
it, each of such lines and names is treated as a
paragraph, and takes its proper marks before or after
it, or both.</p>

<p>It is much better practice in printing to put such
matter in smaller type than the type of the main text;
or, if in type-written manuscript, to identify it by less
space between its lines than is used between the lines
preceding and following it, or by indenting the lines
of the quotation more than the regular paragraph
indention. Quotations thus identified need no quotation-marks.</p>

<p>It was formerly the practice to put quotation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span> marks
at the beginning of every line of a quotation
however long; and occasionally this style is now
followed, especially in legal documents.</p>

<p>The practice in many newspaper offices furnishes,
we think, a satisfactory solution of the problem.
When quoted matter is given close grammatical
relation to the text, the marks of quotation are used
before the first word of the quotation and before each
line, with the proper closing marks at the end of the
quotation. Such a quotation should not exceed ten
or twelve lines in length. Larger quotations should
be put in smaller type, and without the marks. Even
short ones may be so treated.</p>

<p class="center" style="page-break-before: always;"><span class="smcap lowercase">OTHER USES OF QUOTATION-MARKS</span></p>

<p>A word or group of words is sometimes enclosed
in quotation-marks to give to such word or group of
words a meaning somewhat different from its usual
meaning. This use of the marks has a very wide
range; and it is difficult to define the full scope of it.
Its significance will appear in illustrative examples:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>105. A drop-folio is generally used on a page on which
a chapter begins or on a page containing an illustration
extending to its top.</p>

<p>105-1. A “drop-folio” is a page-number that is put
at the bottom of the page.</p></blockquote>

<p>In No. 105-1 “drop-folio” is singled out as an
uncommon word, as if quoted; and this fact is shown
by the marks. In No. 105 it is used as is any other
word in the sentence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>106. He received “big wages,” $1.00 a day.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p>In No. 106 we put “big wages” in quotation-marks
to imply that some one has used this familiar
expression in a boastful way without telling the whole
truth, which is exposed in the small sum that follows.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>107. She was very fond of “five-o’clocks.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In No. 107 the writer implies that the afternoon
teas of society are frivolous things. This is perhaps
a purely conventional use of the marks, without an
underlying reason for the meaning thus given.</p>

<p>In the next sentence the writer groups, by means
of the marks, certain words into a title, which are
identified by quotation-marks. Italics would answer
the same purpose; but the former marks are preferred:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>108. This fundamental work might be called, “An
Introduction to the Study of Literature”; or, “The Elements
of Literature.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The above sentence is quoted from an educational
magazine of high standing, printed by a Press that
gives much attention to style. The use of the semicolon
and comma in the sentence is the conventional
style of punctuating compound book-titles, as illustrated
in Sentence 96. But the quotation-marks
show that this is not a compound title, but alternative
titles. The real meaning would be more clearly expressed
by the use of “either” after “called”; and
this shows that the punctuation is wrong. Either the
semicolon and the comma or the quotation-marks
must be omitted. The meaning to be conveyed will
determine which marks to omit.</p>

<p>If the semicolon and comma are not the proper
marks here, how shall we determine what mark, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
any, should precede “or”? Simply by the degree of
liability to error in making a wrong combination of
words at this point. The quotation-marks before
“or” close the first quotation, making a complete
group of words; and the quotation-marks following
“or” open a new group of words. As there is here no
liability on the part of the reader to make a wrong
grouping out of some words that precede and some
that follow “or,” a mark before “or” can serve no
purpose. Each group is bound up in its own marks of
quotation, and is a name; and the two names are
alternatives. With this interpretation of the meaning
of the language as determined by the quotation-marks
alone, the sentence would be punctuated as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>108-1. This fundamental work might be called, “An
Introduction to the Study of Literature” or “The Elements
of Literature.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The use of the comma after “called” in the above
sentence is purely conventional. It is somewhat like
the use of the comma before “that” following “is,” as
treated elsewhere. Or, we may say, it is a purely
rhetorical use, as the reading of the somewhat long
title seems to require a pause after “called,” in order
to identify the group to follow. The omission of the
comma could not be called poor punctuation.</p>

<p class="tb">Quotation-marks are used in the report of a
conversation or dialogue in which the names of the
speakers are not printed at the beginning of their
respective remarks, as is done in the printing of a
drama. However, some writers do not use quotation-marks
for this purpose, and none are used in the
frequent conversations in the Bible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>If the language of a quotation is broken off by
a writer for the purpose of inserting words not a part
of the quotation, each of the two parts into which the
quoted matter is thus broken, is enclosed in quotation-marks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>109. “We shall start,” he said, “at early dawn.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Words to which special attention is called, otherwise
than for emphasis, are put in quotation-marks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>110. The words “virile,” “psychological,” “strenuous,”
etc., are useful words in their proper places, but
weak words when out of place.</p></blockquote>

<p>The titles of books, plays, songs, poems, and the
like, when referred to in one’s text, are put in quotation-marks
by some writers and in italics by others.
The former seems to be the more common usage.
Mr. De Vinne says “italic is preferred by bookish
men.” Most writers make an exception to the above
rule in the case of the titles of well-known books.</p>

<p>The same rule applies to periodicals, including
transactions and proceedings issued, at least, quarterly.
In most journal offices there is a well-established
convention: the journal puts in italics the name of
another periodical, and in caps and small caps its
own name appearing in its own text.</p>

<p class="tb">When the closing marks of quotation follow a
word or group of words that is also followed by
another mark of punctuation, the positions of the two
marks are determined by the relation such other mark
of punctuation bears to the quoted matter. If it belongs
to, and is therefore required by, the quoted
matter, it goes within the quotation-marks. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
comma and the period always precede the final quotation-marks,
and do so simply because they appear
better thus arranged on the printed page. The
semicolon, the colon, the interrogation-point, and the
exclamation-point follow or precede the closing marks
of quotation according to their relation to the quoted
matter. The comma and period also precede
marks of reference (superior figures, stars, etc.) and
the degree mark, while the semicolon, colon, the interrogation-point,
and the exclamation-point follow
them. On page 3, above, a superior figure follows a
colon. It does so because it refers to the colon, not
to what precedes the colon.</p>

<p class="center" style="page-break-before: always;">EXAMPLES</p>

<p>1. “Movies” showing war scenes that arouse the
martial spirit are objectionable to all pacifists.</p>

<p class="small">The above sentence contains two words treated as they are
found today in practically all periodicals and books using them.
The words <i>movies</i> and <i>pacifists</i> (also written <i>pacificists</i>) are
newcomers in English, and are not found in any dictionary.
Why is the former put in quotation-marks and the latter not?
It is probably because all editors recognize “movies” as a word
of doubtful propriety, and therefore give it the conventional
marks. On the other hand, the word “pacifist,” whose meaning is
so apparent and whose form is so regular, has not been regarded
as of doubtful propriety, generally recognized as a stranger, and
so has been accepted without the introduction of the conventional
marks of quotation.</p>

<p>3. Portrait of Major-General Henry Dearborn.
By Gilbert Stuart.</p>

<p>4. “Our Boatman.” By John La Farge.</p>

<p class="small">The above legends (inscriptions) appear under two pictures
in a well-edited current magazine. Why does the title in No.
4 take marks of quotation, while that in No. 3 does not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p class="small">Two reasons may be given for the use of the marks in No. 4,
while one reason is sufficient for their absence in No. 3. “Our
Boatman” is the title of the painting, and is treated as a quotation,
and therefore requires the quotation-marks. Secondly, the
words “Our Boatman” are not used in their literal sense as
descriptive of a man who acts as our boatman,—that is, the
picture is not a photograph of John Smith, our boatman, but is
an idealization of a man of his class. To give the words other
than a literal meaning, the marks are used.</p>

<p class="small">In No. 3 the language is taken in its literal meaning, and
even may be that of the editor of the magazine, thus requiring
no marks. Probably no painter would put upon his canvas “A
Portrait of John Smith.”</p>

<p>5. “Justice,” said Webster, “is the great interest
of man on earth”; and Mr. Root laid it down as a
rule, when Secretary of State, that we should not
only observe justice in our relations, but that we
should be just.</p>

<p>6. Professor John Finley, in “The French in the
Heart of America,” insists, with pardonable enthusiasm,
that we got our finest democratic ideals from
the French settlers in the Mississippi Valley, and
that here was nourished</p>

<p class="m padl15 padr1"><small>a national democracy founded on the equalities, the
freedoms, and the fraternities of the frontier so vital, so
powerful, that it became the dominant nationalistic force

BRACKETS AND PARENTHESES</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> principal use of brackets is to show that a
bracketed word or group of words in a quotation is
inserted by the writer using the quoted language, and
not by the author of such language. Parentheses, on
the other hand, are used by a writer, as we have already
seen, to enclose a parenthetical word or group of words
in his own language.</p>

<p>Some examples that furnish apparent exceptions
to these general statements considered as rules, may
serve to emphasize the principle of this punctuation.</p>

<p>The following examples (Nos. 112-115) are taken
from the “Style Book” of the Government Printing-Office.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—We follow in the examples the capitalization and
punctuation of the original. For this reason we do not use a
hyphen in writing the quoted title (Style Book), above.</p>

<p>These examples are given in this style-book for
the guidance of type-setters in their work in the
Government Printing-Office. They appear to be extracts
from the <i>Congressional Record</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>112. Mr. SPEAKER. Is there any objection to the
consideration of this bill at this time? [After a pause.]
There is no objection.</p>

<p>113. Mr. SPEAKER (after a pause). If no gentleman
claims the floor, the Clerk will proceed with the reading
of the bill.</p>

<p>114. Mr. HEALD. The gentleman from Kentucky
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherley</span>] stated that he would support the measure.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>115. Mr. HEALD. The gentleman from Kentucky,
Col. <span class="smcap">Sherley</span>, stated that he would support the measure.</p></blockquote>

<p>In these examples the names of the persons speaking
are so manifestly inserted by the reporter that
they need no identification marks.</p>

<p>In No. 112 three words are inserted within the
text by the reporter, and take brackets for identification
as matter inserted in the language of another.</p>

<p>In No. 113 the same three words, manifestly inserted
by the reporter, take parentheses. They do so
because they clearly belong to what precedes, which
is not a part of the text, but is the reporter’s language.
The use of brackets here would be bad punctuation.
The parentheses are used because the words enclosed
are purely <i>parenthetical</i> in their relation to the preceding
word, which is the reporter’s language.</p>

<p>In No. 114 the words “Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherley</span>” are inserted
by the reporter, and therefore take brackets. In No.
115 the words “Col. <span class="smcap">Sherley</span>” are the language of
Mr. Heald, and therefore take the usual punctuation
(commas).</p>

<p>Another apparent exception to the above rule is
found in the various modes of printing stage directions
in dramatic composition. As such directions
have no reference to the meaning of the language of
the text, it is desirable, in printing them, to show this
fact by their form. In the main, such directions are
either centered lines shorter than the text, or are
indented more than the usual space of the paragraph.
They may be enclosed in brackets or parentheses, and
be printed in either italic or Roman type, or in italics
without the brackets or parentheses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<p>If a direction precedes, as it does sometimes, the
speech to which it belongs, and is in the opening line
of such speech, it necessarily is enclosed in brackets.
If it follows and ends the last line of the speech, it
takes a single bracket at the beginning of the direction.
If it follows, and is put below, the last line, it
takes a single bracket, or is printed in the style of the
direction preceding the speech.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the variety of style in printing
stage directions grows out of the fact that they are
sometimes identified as stage directions by their location
and the style of type (italic), and therefore do
not necessarily require brackets for further identification.</p>

<p>We shall not take space to illustrate the above
varieties of punctuation. Examples can readily be
found in almost any library.</p>

<p>We have dwelt perhaps more at length upon this
varied punctuation than its importance may seem to
justify; but, it seems to us, we may see in it a principle
underlying even conventional punctuation.</p>

<p class="tb">Our next sentence illustrates a very common use
of brackets. In this sentence we make the first
enclosure (<i>sic</i>), the second being that of the writer
who made the quotation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>116. In one of John Smith’s quaint letters to the
Royal Council of Virginia, sitting in London, he says:
“And I humbly entreat you hereafter, [<i>sic</i>] let us know
what we [are to] receive, and not stand to the sailors’
courtesy to leave us what they please.”</p></blockquote>

<p>When inserted in a quotation, the Latin word
“<i>sic</i>,” meaning <i>thus</i>, signifies that what immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
precedes it is found in the original. By thus calling
attention to it, the writer who makes the quotation
implies that an error exists at this point. Our own
insertion of “<i>sic</i>” is meant to say that the comma
preceding it is in the original, and to question its correctness.
The position of the comma makes “hereafter”
qualify what precedes, as if it read, “I hereafter
entreat you.” The evident meaning is, “hereafter
let us know.”</p>

<p>The words “are to,” enclosed in the next brackets,
were inserted by the writer who quoted from John
Smith’s letter.</p>

<p>“Sic” is put in italics because this is the conventional
way of writing most words from a foreign
language. The words “are to,” being a suggested
part of the text, are put in the text letter. Words
thus supplied by the translators of the Bible are put
in italics, simply to show their character, as is explained
in the preface or elsewhere. Brackets are
not used in the Bible text.</p>

<p>Sometimes a line of poetry is too long for the
type-measure in which the poem is set. If one or
more words of such line are carried forward to make a
new and very short line, the space between the full
line above and the full line below such short line may
be as wide as the space between two verses, and thus
present a bad effect to the eye. To avoid this the
extra word or words may be put in the line above, if
the space permits, and at its end, with a single bracket
at the left to cut it off from the preceding words in
the same line.</p>

<p>It is a common practice in legal and commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
work to enclose in parentheses Arabic figures corresponding
to the preceding number expressed in
words. This practice often gives rise to a mistake
that, when pointed out, is plain enough to anyone:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>117. Pay to John Smith or order twenty-five ($25.00)
dollars.</p></blockquote>

<p>The matter in the parentheses should be simply
“25,” to correspond with what precedes; or the sentence
should be written thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>117-1. Pay to John Smith or order twenty-five dollars
($25.00).</p></blockquote>

<p>When a woman signs her name to a letter, especially
a letter to a stranger, and wishes to give other
information than the name conveys, or to indicate
how she should be addressed in a reply to her letter,
parentheses are used for the purpose:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>118. <span class="smcap">Mary Louise Brown.</span></p>

<p><span class="h">118. </span>(<span class="smcap">Mrs. George H. Brown.</span>)</p></blockquote>

<p>If she wishes simply to convey information as to
whether she is a married or an unmarried woman, she
uses the proper title, enclosed in parentheses, before

<p>In Sentences 99, 100, and 102 we saw a purely
conventional use of parentheses and brackets for enclosing
interrogation-and exclamation-points to express
doubt and surprise, respectively.</p>

<p class="center" style="page-break-before: always;"><span class="smcap lowercase">PUNCTUATION WITHIN PARENTHESES OR BRACKETS</span></p>

<p>Matter within parentheses or brackets refers to
what precedes these marks, which may be a mark of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
punctuation, a single word, a group of words forming
part of a sentence, an entire sentence, or two or more
sentences.</p>

<p>We cannot show by the punctuation how much of
the preceding matter is referred to; but a conventional
treatment of the punctuation for this purpose is
helpful, even though such treatment is not uniform.</p>

<p>The enclosed matter either falls between the parts
of a sentence or follows a sentence. When within a
sentence the enclosed matter does not begin with a
capital letter, even though a full sentence, unless the
first word is a proper noun; nor does it take a period
at its end. If, however, the language is either interrogative
or exclamatory, it takes the proper mark
to show this; and such mark is placed within the
parentheses or brackets.</p>

<p>When the enclosed matter follows a sentence, it
may refer to a word or to a small group of words within
such sentence, to all of the sentence, or to two or
more preceding sentences. It is at this point that
a conventional treatment of the subject may be helpful,
the object of such treatment being to show, at
a glance, how far the reference extends. If the enclosed
matter refers to the last word of the sentence,
or to a short group of words near the end, it receives
the same treatment given it when wholly within the
sentence. If such enclosed matter refers to a larger
part of the sentence than above described, to the
entire sentence, or to two or more preceding sentences,
it is regarded as an independent sentence. As such
it is separated from the preceding sentence by the
space usually put between sentences; it begins with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
a capital letter; and the proper end-mark is put within
the parentheses, with no mark following outside.</p>

<p>We believe there is only one mark used within
parentheses with reference to a mark outside. The
English practice, which is followed by a number of
high-class periodicals in this country, is as follows:
if a comma is required where a parenthesis is to be
inserted, a comma is placed before the first enclosing
mark, and is repeated at the end of the language
within the parentheses.</p>

<p>We prefer to use only one mark when required
by the text without reference to the parenthesis, and
to put it after the parentheses, thus more clearly confining
the parenthesis to what precedes.</p>

<p>Our illustrative examples will show these points
more clearly.</p>

<p>5. “Yours of the 14th has just arrived, and I
hasten to reply to it.</p>

<p>“Here is a list of the six best novels in the English
language:</p>

<p class="m padl4">
“Tom Jones. (Fielding.)<br />
“Tristam Shandy. (Sterne.)<br />
“David Copperfield. (Dickens.)<br />
“Henry Esmond. (Thackeray.)<br />
“The Cloister and the Hearth. (Reade.)<br />
“The Egoist. (Meredith.)<br />
</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether ‘Tristam Shandy’ can
strictly be called a novel. If the rules of your game
cut it out, then I would replace it by</p>

<p>
“Kenilworth, (Scott,)<br />
</p>

<p>to my mind the most perfect of Scott’s novels.”</p>

<p class="small">While we have not used quotation-marks with our illustrative
sentences and examples, practically all of which are quoted,
we do so with the above examples, in order to exhibit their use.</p>

<p class="small">The punctuation of this example illustrates the following
points:</p>

<p class="small">1. The use of marks of quotation at the beginning of every
paragraph, or group of words put in paragraph form, with like
closing marks after the last line, informs the reader that the
paragraphs quoted appear consecutively in the original.</p>

<p class="small">2. The titles of the books named, with one exception, are
not enclosed in marks of quotation in the original. If they were
so enclosed, each title in our example would be enclosed in single
marks of quotation, in addition to the double marks at the
beginning.</p>

<p class="small">3. The name of each novel (Tom Jones, etc.) is treated as
a complete sentence, and so takes a period after it. The matter
following each sentence (name of a novel) refers to the entire
sentence, thus requiring a period within the marks of parenthesis
enclosing the name of the author.</p>

<p class="small">4. The treatment of the last-named title (Kenilworth) is
somewhat unusual. It is put in paragraph form, probably to
conform to the paragraph form above; but it lacks the usual
introduction of particulars that calls for the paragraph form.</p>

<p class="small">The commas before and within the parentheses follow the
English style. As a comma is required between “Kenilworth”
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>and the explanatory group of words following the parenthesis,
we should use only one, putting it after the marks of parenthesis.</p>

<p class="small">Those who adopt the English style apparently always use
the commas when the matter within parentheses or brackets
falls within the sentence, even though the relation between what
follows and what precedes the parentheses or brackets does not
require a comma. We consider such punctuation bad, for it
appears to treat the matter so enclosed as both <i>slightly</i> and
<i>wholly</i> parenthetical. Our next example (No. 6), a quotation,
illustrates this point.</p>

<p class="small">5. We do not know why “Tristam Shandy” takes marks
of quotation (single marks in the example), while the names of
the other books take none.</p>

<p>6. I permitted myself, [he said,] the prophecy
that their prejudices were destined to vanish.</p>

<p class="small">While we use a comma, as in the paragraph (No. 5)
preceding Example 6, after parentheses or brackets when
required by the language outside of the parentheses or
brackets, and use no comma unless so required, we think the
English practice poor punctuation. This conventional use of
two commas ignores the sense relation between the groups of
words preceding and following the parentheses or brackets,
which sense relation may be determined by the presence or the
absence of a comma.</p>

ABBREVIATIONS AND MISCELLANY</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> shall not attempt to treat the subject of
abbreviations exhaustively or even fully, for it goes
beyond the subject of punctuation; but its importance
seems to justify its consideration at some length.</p>

<p>In the best printing-offices, if their expert copy-readers
prepare the manuscript, few abbreviations
are permitted in book-work; and it is well to follow
their rules in all formal, if not in all business, correspondence.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">FORM OF ADDRESS</h3>

<p>The abbreviations in forms of address accepted
by the printing-offices issuing three works on punctuation
and style, especially mentioned in our preface,
are the following:</p>

<p>By the De Vinne Press, <i>Mr.</i>, <i>Mrs.</i>, <i>Messrs.</i>, <i>Jr.</i>,
and <i>Sr.</i></p>

<p>By the University of Chicago Press, <i>Mr.</i>, <i>Messrs.</i>,
<i>Mrs.</i> (French, <i>M.</i>, <i>MM.</i>, <i>Mme</i>, <i>Mlle</i>), <i>Dr.</i>, <i>Rev.</i>,
<i>Hon.</i>, <i>St.</i> [Saint], and <i>Esq.</i></p>

<p>By The Riverside Press, <i>Mr.</i>, <i>Mrs.</i>, <i>Messrs.</i>, <i>M.</i>,
<i>Mme.</i>, <i>Mlle.</i>, <i>Jr.</i>, <i>Sr.</i>, <i>Dr.</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, <i>Rev.</i>, <i>Hon.</i></p>

<p>These lists are somewhat misleading. Although
not uniform, it is probable that the practice of the
three offices from which they come, is uniform, with
one exception. In the list from the “Manual for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
Writers” (University of Chicago Press), <i>Mme</i> and
<i>Mlle</i> are not written with periods, as, we think, they
should be.</p>

<p>It is a matter of course that the plural form <i>MM.</i>,
given in only one list, and the plural forms <i>Mmes.</i>
and <i>Mlles.</i>, not given at all, are treated the same as
the abbreviations of the singular forms of the same.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—We are unable to interpret the parenthesis in the
above list from the University of Chicago Press. The terms
within the parentheses are only remotely, if at all, explanatory
of the preceding terms; and, although they belong in the list of
abbreviations, they are taken out of the list by being put in
parentheses. Moreover, “Mlle,” which is within the parentheses,
has no reference to any term outside of the marks.</p>

<p>While the above and other points in abbreviations
discussed herein, are closely to be observed in the
text of a book and in formal correspondence, abbreviations
of technical terms, in tabulated work, in
foot-notes, indexes, etc., are used freely.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">FIRM OR CORPORATION NAMES</h3>

<p>In business correspondence courtesy requires that
abbreviations adopted in a firm or a corporation
name be carefully observed by others, regardless of
the in elegance of such forms.</p>

<p><i>Bro.</i>, <i>Bros.</i>, and <i>Co.</i> are used in firm names following
<i>&amp;</i>, but not otherwise. They should always be
spelled out when preceded by a proper adjective.</p>

<p><i>John Smith &amp; Bro.</i>; <i>Brown, Smith &amp; Co.</i>, and like
forms are used.</p>

<p>In <i>Smith Brothers</i>, <i>Smith Company</i>, and like forms
the final word is not abbreviated.</p>

<p>While the “short and” (&amp;) is commonly used in
firm names, “and” is frequently seen:</p>

<p><i>Armour and Company</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p>It is very rare that a comma is used before the
final “and” or “&amp;” in firm names of three or more
words constituting a series. If a firm prefers so to
punctuate its name, others who write the name should
not insert a comma.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">FIGURES</h3>

<p>As there are few fixed conventional uses for figures,
we shall give simply our preferences.</p>

<p>In ordinary reading matter, spell out all round
numbers, and numbers of one or two digits, unless of
a technical character. When several numbers occur
close together, and are to be compared, they may be
expressed in figures:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>120. Admission, one dollar.</p>

<p>120-1. Admission, fifty cents.</p>

<p>120-2. Admission: Men, $2; women, $1.50; children,
50 cents.</p></blockquote>

<p>In No. 120-2 we use “50,” instead of “fifty,”
because figures are used to express other numbers in
the sentence.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">TIME OF DAY</h3>

<p>The time of day is generally spelled out in ordinary
reading matter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>121. We shall start at four o’clock this afternoon.</p></blockquote>

<p>But with <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> and <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> (these abbreviations are
best set in small capitals) figures are always used:</p>

<p>121-1. We shall start at 4 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">TEMPERATURE, ETC.</h3>

<p>Figures are used to express temperature, specific
gravity, and like technical matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>122. The specific gravity of gold is 19.27. Its melting-point
is 1947° F. (1064° C.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The letters “th,” “st,” and “d” (“d” is preferable
to “nd” or “rd”) should not be used with the number
expressing the day of the month, except when preceding
the name of the month:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>123. We left on July 9, 1915.</p>

<p>123-1. We left on July 9.</p>

<p>123-2. We left on the 9th of July.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many good writers would use “th” in No. 123-1,
probably because it expresses the usual oral form of
the date.</p>

<p>In printing consecutive numbers, like dates, numbers
of pages, etc., certain omissions may be indicated
by the dash; but the exact meaning of this and
another mode of writing these numbers should be
understood. Examples will illustrate this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>124. He was in England in 1914-15.</p>

<p>124-1. He spent the winter of 1914-15 in England.</p>

<p>125. Further information will be found on pages
25-27.</p>

<p>125-1. Further information will be found on pages
25, 26, 27.</p>

<p>125-2. Further information will be found elsewhere
(pp. 25, 26) in this work.</p>

<p>125-3. Further information will be found on pages
25 to 40.</p></blockquote>

<p>No. 124, strictly interpreted, means <i>all</i> of the two
years indicated; but it may be an indefinite portion
of the last of 1914 and a like portion of the first of
1915. In No. 124-1 the latter meaning is specifically
given by the word <i>winter</i>.</p>

<p>No. 125 means that the subject is treated con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>tinuously
on the pages mentioned; but it may not
occupy <i>all</i> of pages 25 and 27.</p>

<p>No. 125-1 means that the subject is referred to on
each of the pages numbered, but not to the exclusion
of other matter.</p>

<p>In No. 125-2, in order to save space, the comma
takes the place of “and” between two numbers, just
as the dash takes the place of “to” between “25”
and “27” in No. 125. Such omission of “and” is
found in the text only when the figures are enclosed
in parentheses; but it is common without the parentheses
in foot-notes, tables, and indexes.</p>

<p>In No. 125-3 we use “to” instead of a dash.
“To” is generally used when a considerable number
of pages is named. No definite rule can be given
for such usage.</p>

<p>An apparent exception to the interpretation of
the numbers in No. 125 is not infrequently found in
the manner of writing the street numbers of a building,
especially as found on letter-heads:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>126. John Smith &amp; Co.</p>

<p>25-27 Water Street</p>

<p>Chicago</p></blockquote>

<p>As buildings on one side of a street take the odd
numbers, and on the other side the even numbers, we
know that John Smith &amp; Co. are located at 25 <i>and</i> 27
Water Street.</p>

<p>An accepted form of shortening an address which
contains the words <i>street</i> and <i>avenue</i> is to write
“avenue” first with its number expressed in words,
followed by the street with its number in figures:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>127. He resides at the corner of Tenth Avenue and
52d Street.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>If a house number precedes the spelled-out name
of the street, the former takes figures, in order readily
to distinguish it from the name of the street:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>127-1. He resides at 34 Tenth Avenue South.</p></blockquote>

<p>If it is desirable to begin a sentence with a number,
such number should be spelled out, and not expressed
in figures:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>128. Two thousand people met in the park.</p></blockquote>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">BIBLE REFERENCES</h3>

<p>As the forms of Bible references are very numerous
we shall give only two, which, we think, represent the
best modern usage:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>129. Matt, iv, 4; 1 Cor. i, 29.</p>

<p>130. Gen. 2:3-6, 9; 3:17.</p></blockquote>

<p>As the Roman numerals were formerly, and still
are to some extent, followed by a period, this usage
would give the following in the place of No. 129:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>129-1. Matt. iv. 4; 1 Cor. i. 29</p></blockquote>

<p>We think No. 129 the better style.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">FOOT-NOTES</h3>

<p>The style in foot-notes is so varied that we shall
consider only one or two points involved.</p>

<p>Superior figures in the text have taken the place
almost altogether of the star, dagger, etc., both
because they are less conspicuous and because they
can be extended in number.</p>

<p>The lower-case superior italic letters are sometimes
used instead of, or together with, superior
figures, as in the Bible.</p>

<p>In ordinary work, the superior figures or letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
follow the word or group of words concerning which
the reference is made. In the Bible the figures and
letters precede such word or words.</p>

<p>The figures before the notes corresponding to the
figures in the text are generally superior figures; but
the ordinary figures are sometimes used, because,
as each number begins a paragraph, the superior
figures are too small to look well.</p>

<p>The punctuation of foot-notes, and other details
of their composition, are treated differently by
different writers. A single illustration will serve to
show a well-recognized style of composing such notes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>130. 5 Morris Schaff, “The Battle of the Wilderness,”
<i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, June, 1909.</p>

<p>130-1. 5 Morris Schaff, The Battle of the Wilderness,
Vol. ii, p. 204.</p></blockquote>

<p>No. 130 specifies foot-note No. 5, and refers to an
article in a magazine, which is named.</p>

<p>No. 130-1 refers to a book, the volume and page
being indicated.</p>

<p>These foot-notes often appear in the following
form:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>130-2. 5. Schaff, Morris: The Battle of the Wilderness.</p></blockquote>

<p>Foot-notes are often extensively used in scientific
periodicals and books; and the larger establishments
that print such matter usually have their style-cards,
which should be followed by authors submitting
manuscripts to such establishments.</p>

<p>The lower-case italic letters, “<i>a</i>,” “<i>b</i>,” and “<i>c</i>,”
and sometimes the superior letters, are used to indicate
the first, second, and third parts of a verse, para<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>graph,
or page referred to by an accompanying figure.
For instance, Romans vi, 5a means the first part of
verse 5 of Romans vi.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">STAR, DAGGER, ETC.</h3>

<p>Because of the clumsy appearance of these marks,
and because of the inconvenience they cause in the
mechanical make-up of printed matter, they are used
sparingly; but they are quite indispensable in tabulated
matter, scientific works, etc.</p>

<p>If several of these marks are required on a page,
they follow the following order: star, dagger, double
dagger, section, parallel lines, paragraph.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">MISCELLANEOUS</h3>

<p>The word <i>cent</i> in <i>per cent</i> is now generally written
without a period.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>Etc.</i> is preferable to <i>&amp;c.</i> when used for “and
others” or “and so on”; but not a few good writers
use the latter for this purpose.</p>

<p class="tb">The terms <i>4to</i>, <i>8vo</i>, <i>12mo</i>, etc., used to denote
the sizes of books, are not abbreviations, and so do
not take periods after them. Each number stands
for a suppressed part of the word in which it appears.</p>

<p class="tb">The abbreviations <i>i. e.</i>, <i>e. g.</i>, <i>vs.</i>, <i>viz.</i>, etc., are often
printed in italics. The words for which they stand
are generally preferred to the abbreviations.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">THE APOSTROPHE</h3>

<p>There are but few uses of the apostrophe, and
they are well settled, as follows:</p>

<p>1. To indicate the omission of letters or figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
in contractions: <i>ne’er</i>, <i>don’t</i>, <i>it’s</i> (it is), <i>’t</i> will, class
of <i>’83</i>, the gold-seekers of <i>’49</i>, etc.</p>

<p>2. To indicate the possessive case of nouns, but
not of pronouns: <i>Henry’s</i>, <i>man’s</i>, <i>Jones’s</i>, a <i>boy’s</i>
task, the <i>boys’</i> play-ground, for <i>conscience’</i> sake, etc.</p>

<p>3. To indicate, with <i>s</i>, the plurals of letters,
figures, symbols, and certain unusual or peculiar
names: <i>i’s</i> and <i>t’s</i>, <i>6’s</i> and <i>7’s</i>, four <i>t’s</i>, several
<i>D.D’s</i>, the <i>stay-at-home’s</i>, etc.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;">WHEREAS—RESOLVED</h3>

<p>In the absence of a better place to note the conventional
form of printing and punctuating the above
words and what follows them, we consider the subject
here. Two illustrations are sufficient to show the
best usage. We prefer the first style. The second is
that of the Century Dictionary, and is good style:</p>

<p>130A. <span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, Our neighbors have suffered
great loss<span class="gesperrt3"> ...</span></p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That we give them immediate financial
assistance<span class="gesperrt3"> ...</span></p>

<p>130B. <i>Whereas</i>, Our neighbors have suffered
great loss<span class="gesperrt3"> ...</span></p>

<p>Resolved, that we give them immediate financial
assistance<span class="gesperrt3"> ...</span></p>

<p>If the words “therefore be it” are used, they are
put at the end of the line preceding “Resolved,” and
set in Roman, with or without a dash following:</p>

<p>130C. <span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, Our neighbors have suffered
great loss; therefore be it</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That<span class="gesperrt3"> ...</span></p>

COMPOUND WORDS</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> add this chapter on compound words to a work
on punctuation simply to record our high estimate of
the value of the subject, and our protest against its
complete neglect by high schools and colleges, as well
as by very many good writers.</p>

<p>As in spelling, a few rules may be helpful; but, also
as in spelling, only continuous reference to a dictionary
or to a good list of compound words, will enable
a writer to attain any degree of perfection in their use.</p>

<p>We believe there is only one fairly complete work
on the subject, and that is by Mr. F. Horace Teall,
who was a department editor of the Standard Dictionary,
having in charge especially the matter of compound
words. His work is entitled “English Compound
Words and Phrases.”</p>

<p>We shall discuss only two illustrative examples;
and they are selected for the purpose of emphasizing
the importance of the subject, and the value of common
sense in the application of principles governing
the determination of the form words take to express
different meanings.</p>

<p>Our first example may seem to be a somewhat
commonplace one, but it may be a helpful illustration.
It has been submitted to a large number of suitable
persons as a test of the general knowledge extant on
the subject among printers, proof-readers, teachers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
and writers. The result revealed almost complete
ignorance of the subject.</p>

<p>Which of the following forms is correct, and why?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>131. (1) back bone, (2) back-bone, (3) backbone.</p></blockquote>

<p>The three forms are correct, but each has a special
meaning:</p>

<p>1. In the form “back bone,” the word “back”
stands in the position of an adjective, and is to be
interpreted as we interpret any adjective standing
before a noun. If we know the meaning of a word
thus used, and the meaning of the word it precedes,
we know the meaning of the two words. “Back” here
designates one of two or more bones in a row, say,
lying on a table.</p>

<p>2. In “back-bone” we have an illustration of a
process of the growth of language. Professor W. D.
Whitney, the distinguished philologist, says that the
composition of words out of independent elements, is
more important than any other process in the development
of language. The stage of development may
determine the word’s form.</p>

<p>“Back-bone” means the bone of the back, or the
spinal column. It is a type of a large class of hyphenated
compounds which are merely elliptical inversions;
in this case, the word is such an inversion of <i>bone of
the back</i>.</p>

<p>3. “Backbone” is an example of words whose
meanings are traceable, sometimes readily and sometimes
with difficulty, to their parts. It is easy to
understand that a man with a real “back-bone” has
<i>grit</i>, which is one meaning of “backbone” written as
a solid word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Webster’s New International Dictionary does not
give the hyphenated form of these two words; notwithstanding
this, we believe this form has the sanction of reason and of
convention.</p>

<p>The principles involved in determining the above
forms are very simple, and seem self-evident.</p>

<p>The process of language-development is rapidly
going on; and, as every corrector of manuscript knows,
incorrect forms of words are exceedingly numerous.
Often they are made in attempts at short cuts in
language. When they may not be changed by the
corrector, the hyphen is often useful in revealing their
meaning. The use of the hyphen must be based upon
reason. Usually, the purpose is to tie together two
words to form one adjective or one noun.</p>

<p>The words in our next two illustrative sentences
were frequently seen some time ago when almost the
entire press of the country was discussing a subject
calling for the use of these words. The words were
invariably printed improperly; and we shall print
them so in the illustrative sentences:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>132. Dr. Keene is the medical school inspector of
Minneapolis.</p>

<p>133. Mr. Flexner is the medical school inspector of
the Carnegie Foundation.</p></blockquote>

<p>What is the meaning of the language of these
sentences? To the careful reader “Dr.” and “Mr.”
connote quite different things, and thus suggest
different relations between the words “medical school
inspector.”</p>

<p>Let the hyphen answer the question:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>132-1. Dr. Keene is the medical school-inspector of
Minneapolis.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>133-1. Mr. Flexner is the medical-school inspector of
the Carnegie Foundation.</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, the sentences say that Dr. Keene
does <i>medical</i> inspection of schools, and that Mr.
Flexner simply inspects medical schools. As a matter
of fact, Mr. Flexner investigated the adequacy of their
methods and means of teaching.</p>

<p>Whether one uses a hyphen in “to-day” or “to-morrow,”
or writes “cannot” as one word or as two
words (can not), is a matter of little importance; but
no educated person should be ignorant of the meanings
of words conveyed by the forms in which they are
written.</p>

<p>The fundamental principles of compounding
words, especially when the meaning of such words is
involved, should be understood by pupils in our grade
schools. This knowledge is easily acquired; and,
once acquired, the pupil will soon form the habit of
consulting the dictionary or a list of words to ascertain
the present-day usage in compounding. The fundamental
principles will tell him that all such combinations
as “present-day” when used as adjectives take
the hyphen.</p>

<p>A few examples will serve to show the beauty
and value of compounding words upon the principles
illustrated above.</p>

common ending (<i>politick</i>) is omitted from the first of two compound
solid words, a hyphen taking its place.</p>

<p class="small">In No. 7 the first “ex officio” is formed of a preposition and
a noun, and means <i>by virtue of office</i>. The second “ex-officio” is
a compound adjective, as is “present-day” in No. 6.</p>

CLOSE AND OPEN PUNCTUATION</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> shall deal with this subject somewhat as we
dealt with compound words, endeavoring simply to
point out the relative values of the “open” and “close”
styles of punctuation.</p>

<p>Almost all writers on punctuation refer to a close
open styles of punctuation, but they make no attempt
clearly to define or to differentiate these terms.
In general, the <i>close</i> style of today is characterized by
a free use of marks where they determine the meaning
of the language, or assist the reader in determining
it easily and quickly; the <i>open</i> style omits most marks
not actually needed to determine the meaning of
the language. The close style may call for too many
marks, and the open style for too few, each causing
confusion to the reader.</p>

<p>It is mainly the comma whose use or omission
determines the style of punctuation; but the use of a
semicolon instead of a comma, may also differentiate
the open from the close style. For instance, the need
of a mark before “and” in Sentence 1 is so unmistakable
that the use of a comma in such sentence
cannot be called close punctuation; but the use of a
semicolon in that sentence, as suggested in Chapter 7,
may properly be called close punctuation. The use
of a comma in the sentence (see Sentence 1-1) may
be considered open punctuation; its omission would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
be poor punctuation, but many open punctuators
would omit it.</p>

<p>While we must recognize the fact that for some
years there has been a tendency among good writers
to use fewer marks, we should disregard any such
tendency based upon a lack of appreciation of the
value of marks or, more specifically, upon ignorance
of the fine sense relations of language so easily overlooked
when not indicated by marks with meanings.</p>

<p>When two groups of words which, standing alone,
take, at least conventionally, a comma, or even a
semicolon, stand together in some relation to another
group or to a single word, this relation may appear
more readily if no mark is used between the two
groups. We have already discussed such omission
between intermediate groups, which are very numerous
in both complex and simple language. The
principle is illustrated in our next sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<table summary="verses" style="line-height: .8em; font-size: .95em;"><tr>
<td class="tdl">133.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="tdl">The Lord my Shepard is;</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">&nbsp;</td><td class="tdl">I shall be well supplied:</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">&nbsp;</td><td class="tdl">Since He is mine and I am His</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">&nbsp;</td><td class="tdl">What can I want beside?</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>In the third line of the stanza “and” so manifestly
groups the two clauses between which it stands that
a comma is not needed to avoid a wrong grouping by
the reader; and, as each clause is connected in sense
with “since,” the omission of a comma between the
clauses more readily ties them as a single group to
“since.” Of course, the use of a comma before
“and,” which would be good punctuation, would
require one at the end of the line.</p>

<p>A good close punctuator omits commas from all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
such groups of words; and a poor open punctuator
does the same, but also improperly omits commas
and semicolons in many other places.</p>

<p>One doing serious composition, or studying
punctuation, may well punctuate closely as he writes,
and afterwards remove all marks whose omission will
improve the grouping and not violate good convention.
The close punctuator who studiously omits a
mark only when he has a reason to do so will rarely
fail to use marks helpfully; the open punctuator who
omits marks too freely will write much obscure
language and much more whose meaning is not
readily obtainable by the reader.</p>

<p>With this general principle established, the
punctuator can readily determine what marks may
be omitted; and, far more important, he can adapt
to his own language the style of punctuation he prefers
to follow.</p>

<p>The punctuation of our next sentence, taken from
an editorial in a recent issue of the <i>New York Times</i>,
has interest for both the close and the open punctuator.
It contains <i>seven</i> commas, only one of which can
safely be omitted, while two more are needed. The
comma after “divisions” may be omitted, but its use
is good punctuation. One is needed after “music,”
in order to show that “and” is followed by the closing
word of a series; and one is imperative after “exhibition,”
to show that what follows is an <i>explanatory</i>,
and not a <i>restrictive</i>, adjective modifier:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>134. There are in this issue eight separate sections,
including, besides the twelve pages of timely pictures,
beautifully executed in roto-gravure and half-tone, and
the ample news and editorial divisions, and those devoted
<span class="pagenum" style="font-weight: normal;"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>to sports, social affairs, music and the stage, a twenty-page
section given up entirely to the development of the
motor car in view of the yearly automobile exhibition
which receives so large a share of public attention.</p></blockquote>

<p>The punctuator who follows the fundamental
principles we have endeavored to set forth, will be
neither a <i>close</i> nor an <i>open</i> punctuator: he will be a
judicious punctuator.</p>

<p class="center" style="page-break-before: always;">EXAMPLES</p>

<p class="small">The following selections, copied from the first edition of this
book, show the value of good punctuation, which, in this instance,
is fairly close punctuation.</p>

<p class="small">The first selection is an extract from Macaulay, picturing
Burke’s knowledge of India; the second is from an article by Mr.
Rowland E. Robinson, in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> for December,
1895. The punctuation of the first is our own; the punctuation
of the second is either the author’s or the editor’s.</p>

<p class="small">A careful study of these selections, with a view to comparing
at what points the punctuation is open and at what points
close, cannot fail to be of interest. For instance, what is the
meaning of the language in the first paragraph of the second
extract (A New England Woodpile) with a comma after “certainty,”
and what would be the meaning without the comma?
Wherein does the punctuation of this extract depart from the
principles we have been discussing?</p>

<p class="center" style="page-break-before: always;"><span class="smcap lowercase">BURKE’S INDIA</span></p>

<p>India and its inhabitants were not to him, as to
most Englishmen, mere names and abstractions, but
a real country and a real people. The burning sun;
the strange vegetation of the palm and the cocoa-tree;
the rice-field and the tank; the huge trees, older than
the Mogul Empire, under which the village crowds
assemble; the thatched roof of the peasant’s hut, and
the rich tracery of the mosque, where the imaum
prayed with his face to Mecca; the drums, and banners,
and gaudy idols; the devotee swinging in the
air; the graceful maiden, with the pitcher on her head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
descending the steps to the river-side; the black faces,
the long beards, the yellow streaks of sect; the turbans
and the flowing robes; the spears and the silver maces;
the elephants with their canopies of state; the gorgeous
palanquin of the prince, and the close litter of the
noble lady—all those things were to him as the objects
amidst which his own life had been passed—as the
objects which lay on the road between Beaconsfield
and St. James’s Street.</p>

<p class="small">The value of punctuation will appear in comparing this
passage, as above printed, with the same passage as it appears in
a work on composition edited by a university professor:</p>

<p class="m"><span class="gesperrt3">&nbsp;...</span>the rice-field; the tank;<span class="gesperrt3"> ... </span>the
thatched roof of the peasant’s hut; the rich tracery of
the mosque where the imaum prays with his face to
Mecca;<span class="gesperrt3"> ... </span>the graceful maiden, with the pitcher
on her head descending the steps to the riverside;
the black faces; the long beards; the yellow
streaks of sect; the turbans and the flowing robes, the
spears and the silver maces;<span class="gesperrt3"> ... </span></p>

<p class="small">By such punctuation the <i>tank</i> is taken out of the <i>rice-field</i>;
the contrast between <i>hut</i> and <i>mosque</i> is lost; the absence of the
comma before “where” makes the imaum pray at a particular
mosque; not the maiden, but her head, is descending the steps;
beards are separated from faces, and yellow streaks of sect may
be on fence posts for aught the reader knows; and turbans and
flowing robes, emblems of rank, are put on spear-and mace-bearers.</p>

<p class="small">And by such punctuation the beauty of the picture is entirely
lost in a mere catalogue of things seen in India—and this is not
literature.</p>

<p class="center" style="page-break-before: always;"><span class="smcap lowercase">A NEW ENGLAND WOODPILE</span></p>

<p>When the charitable mantle of the snow has
covered the ugliness of the earth, as one looks towards
the woodlands he may see a distant dark speck emerge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
from the blue shadow of the woods and crawl slowly
houseward. If born to the customs of this wintry
land, he may guess at once what it is; if not, speculation,
after a little, gives way to certainty, when
the indistinct atom grows into a team of quick-stepping
horses or deliberate oxen hauling a sled-load of
wood to the farm-house.</p>

<p>It is more than that. It is a part of the woods
themselves, with much of their wildness clinging to it,
and with records, slight and fragmentary, yet legible,
of the lives of trees and birds and beasts and men,
coming to our door.</p>

<p>Before the sounds of the creaking sled and the
answering creak of the snow are heard, one sees the
regular puffs of the team’s breath jetting out and
climbing the cold air. The head and shoulders of the
muffled driver then appear, as he sticks by narrow
foothold to the hinder part of his sled, or trots behind
it beating his breast with his numb hands. Prone like
a crawling band of scouts, endwise like battering-rams,
not upright, with green banners waving, Birnam wood
comes to Dunsinane to fight King Frost.</p>

<p>As the woodpile grows at the farm-house door in
a huge windrow of sled-length wood or an even wall
of cord wood, so in the woods there widens a patch of
uninterrupted daylight. Deep shade and barred and
netted shadow turn to almost even whiteness, as the
axe saps the foundation of summer homes of birds and
the winter fastnesses of the squirrels and raccoons.
Here are the tracks of sled and team, where they
wound among rocks and stumps and over cradle knolls
to make up a load; and there are those of the chopper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
by the stump where he stood to fell the tree, and along
the great trough made by its fall. The snow is
flecked with chips, dark or pale according to their kind,
just as they alighted from their short flight, bark up
or down or barkless or edgewise, and with dry twigs
and torn scraps of scattered moss.</p>

<p>When the chopper comes to his work in the morning,
he finds traces of nightly visitors to his white
island that have drifted to its shores out of the gray
sea of woods. Here is the print of the hare’s furry
foot where he came to nibble the twigs of poplar and
birch that yesterday were switching the clouds, but
have fallen, manna-like, from skyward to feed him.
A fox has skirted its shadowy margin, then ventured
to explore it, and in a thawy night a raccoon has
waddled across it.</p>

<p>The woodman is apt to kindle a fire more for company
than warmth, though he sits by it to eat his
cold dinner, casting the crumbs to the chickadees,
that come fearlessly about him at all times. Blazing
or smouldering by turns, as it is fed or starved, the
fire humanizes the woods more than the man does.
Now and then it draws to it a visitor, oftenest a fox-hunter
who has lost his hound, and stops for a
moment to light his pipe at the embers and to ask if
his dog has been seen or heard. Then he wades off
through the snow, and is presently swallowed out of
sight by gray trees and blue shadows. Or the hound
comes in search of his master or a lost trail. He
halts for an instant, with a wistful look on his sorrowful
face, then disappears, nosing his way into the maw
of the woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<p>If the wood is cut “sled length,” which is a saving
of time and also of chips, that will now be made at the
door and will serve to boil the tea-kettle in summer,
instead of rotting to slow fertilization of the woodlot,
the chopper is one of the regular farm hands or a “day
man,” and helps load the sled when it comes. If the
wood is four foot, he is a professional, chopping by
the cord, and not likely to pile his cords too high or
long, nor so closely that the squirrels have much more
trouble in making their way through them than over
them; and the man comes and goes according to his
ambition to earn money.</p>

<p>In whichever capacity the chopper plies his axe,
he is pretty sure to bring no sentimentalism to his
task. He inherits the feeling that was held by the old
pioneers toward trees, who looked upon the noblest of
them as only giant weeds, encumbering the ground,
and best got rid of by the shortest means. To him
the tree is a foe worthy of no respect or mercy, and he
feels the triumph of a savage conqueror when it comes
crashing down and he mounts the prostrate trunk to
dismember it; the more year-marks encircling its
heart, the greater his victory. To his ears, its many
tongues tell nothing, or preach only heresy. Away
with the old tree to the flames! To give him his due,
he is a skillful executioner, and will compel a tree to
fall across any selected stump within its length. If
one could forget the tree, it is a pretty sight to watch
the easy swing of the axe, and see how unerringly
every blow goes to its mark, knocking out chips of a
span’s breadth. It does not look difficult nor like work;
but could you strike “twice in a place,” or in half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
a day bring down a tree twice as thick as your body?
The wise farmer cuts, for fuel, only the dead and
decaying trees in his woodlot, leaving saplings and
thrifty old trees to “stand up and grow better,” as
the Yankee saying is.</p>

<p>There is a prosperous and hospitable look in a
great woodpile at a farmhouse door. Logs with the
moss of a hundred years on them, breathing the odors
of the woods, have come to warm the inmates and all
in-comers. The white smoke of these chimneys is
spicy with the smell of seasoned hard wood, and has
a savor of roasts and stews that makes one hungry.
If you take the back track on a trail of pitchy smoke,
it is sure to lead you to a squalid threshold with its
starved heap of pine roots and half-decayed wood.
Thrown down carelessly beside it is a dull axe, wielded
as need requires with spiteful awkwardness by a
slatternly woman, or laboriously upheaved and let
fall with uncertain stroke by a small boy.</p>

<small>(Published anonymously in 1896)<br />

EXTRACTS FROM PRESS NOTICES OF THE FIRST EDITION</small></p>

<p class="small">The well considered contents of “Why We Punctuate”
should work a reform in the manner of using points. The author
proposes no startling innovations, but approaches his subject
from the plane of pure reason, substituting carefully-thought-out
principles for the empirical rules, which have too long governed
American printing offices, and giving us for the first time a
rationale as foundation for the entire system.</p>

<p class="small">The work itself shows that practically nothing has been done
to advance the science of punctuation for many years, the entire
subject having apparently crystallized after the publication of
Wilson’s book and the compendium of it prepared by Bigelow.
How much these last lacked has not been apparent until this
author took up the cudgels for less arbitrary rule and more distinctions
based on good judgment. He throws light into dark
places and makes it possible at last for a student to acquire a
number of broad principles in place of the interminable rules and
exceptions of the earlier writers.</p>

<p class="small">The book is to be welcomed as a much needed contribution
to a much neglected topic of universal interest.—<i>Chicago Tribune.</i><br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">No student of English should be without this book.—<i>The
Globe</i> (Boston).<br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">The work is valuable, not only to the learner, but also to the
scholar.—<i>Baltimore American.</i><br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">The author has undoubtedly gone to the root of the matter
in his fundamental theory.—<i>The Beacon</i> (Boston).<br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">Though I have read proof twenty-five years or more, I find
I can learn some valuable things from this book.—<i>Henry R. Boss</i>,
<i>Editor of the Proofsheet</i> (Chicago).<br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">With journalistic instinct the author has sought the reasons
for the use of all marks; and instead of copying what previous
authors have said, he has simply told <i>why</i> marks are used.—<i>Philadelphia
Press.</i><br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span></p>

<p class="small">This book unquestionably has a mission, and it seems to us
that the author has performed his task with exceptional intelligence.
The book may be said to represent the best American
usage of our day.—<i>Review of Reviews.</i><br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">The author is a painstaking and intelligent writer, and the
line of reasoning followed by him is original and convincing, while
his explanations and illustrations make the subject of punctuation
both interesting and easy to learn.—<i>Philadelphia Telegraph.<br /><br /></i></p>

<p class="small">It is philosophical, clear, simple, and teaches the intimate
relation between punctuation and the meaning of language. It
shows plainly that we must punctuate to suit our meaning.
An excellent text-book for the schools and for practical reference.—<i>The
Union-Signal</i> (Chicago).<br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">The subject of punctuation seldom receives sufficient attention
in our schools and colleges, and its importance is so great
that such an intelligent discussion of it as that contained in these
pages deserves commendation. It is surprising how much even
educated persons, and even those accustomed to composition,
may gain from such a treatise.—<i>The Congregationalist</i> (Boston).<br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">The whole problem is reduced to the fundamental principles
which control it. They are easily grasped, and the numerous
examples and illustrations collected and arranged by the author,
instead of scattering the impression of the book, only concentrate
the reader’s attention on the few principles which control
the subject. The book is one to be commended.—<i>The Independent</i>
(New York).<br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">The author takes the ground that the use of a mark of punctuation
is determined by its meaning, and the meaning of the
language it governs. He elucidates these meanings clearly, concisely,
and logically. The book may be said to be the only one
available which gives an exhaustive treatment of the reasons and
rules of proper punctuation, plainly and intelligently set forth.—<i>The
Free Press</i> (Detroit).<br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">It is one of the most rational works ever issued on the subject,
and will be of incalculable value as a guide to proper punctuation.
The author departs from the usual set rules commonly
taught in text-books, and simplifies the process by classifying the
marks according to the necessity, or relative length of pause,
required to give our language its proper meaning, not only as
appears to the writer, but also as will appear to the reader.—<i>The
Bee</i> (Omaha).<br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">The author knows how to punctuate himself, and he knows
how to make the principles that guide him clear to others.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">“Why We Punctuate” is a valuable addition to the literature<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
of punctuation. Its examples are, as a rule, particularly happy.
Some of them make plain at a glance the reasons for rules which
have been disputed by many authorities, but which are based on
common sense.... It is a practical guide to punctuation,
and any one who masters it thoroughly ought to be able afterward
always to punctuate correctly.—<i>The Writer</i> (Boston).<br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">The distinctive feature of the book is that it is not a mere
collection of cut-and-dried rules. It goes into the reasons for
the use of the several marks, and deals with the logical relations
of language. It is a book that helps to clear thinking on the
part of the writer who employs it.—<i>The Buffalo Express.</i><br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">Punctuation is treated as based upon the science of language
and not altogether upon grammatical construction. The author’s
examples are all good and new and his ideas original. Some
latitude is allowed, according to construction of sentences, and
common sense is permitted to depart, if clearness of meaning is
desired, from arbitrary rules.—<i>Baltimore Sun.</i><br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">The author of this work has not copied from previous
authors, but has drawn largely upon current literature for illustrative
examples, and has brought together several hundred short
quotations of great interest, beyond the use of examples of correct
punctuation. His reasoning is original. His theories, as explained
and illustrated, make the subject both interesting and
easy to understand.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">The book is valuable to the learner, and the scholar, as well,
and it cannot fail to attract the attention of students of the
English language, and it merits the commendation of all competent
judges.—<i>Journal of Education</i> (Boston).<br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">If the author’s name were on the title-page of his book we
would know whom to thank for the best and most sensible work
on this subject that has yet been published.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">The student of this book, if he masters its teachings, will not
fall into the absurdities and obscurities of mechanical punctuation
on the one hand, or of slovenly punctuation on the other, but
will punctuate in such a way as to make his meaning clear—which
is one essential art in good writing.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="small">“Why We Punctuate” should be in the hands of every newspaper
man and author, and it ought to become a text-book in
